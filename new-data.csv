",March,2018,"College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences",Bachelor of Arts in Communication,Undergraduate,"The researchers chose to conduct a study on the current status of Pinoy independent music scene and the challenges in the production, distribution and promotion of their music. Independent music is defined as self-produced music or music produced, distributed, and promoted without the help of any major record label. The researchers conducted a qualitative research and used interview as the data gathering approach. The key informants chosen for this study are BennyBunnyBand, Lions And Acrobats, Saving Uncle Ben, Kiko Machine, Kissling, Jana Garcia, Jonathan Sibay, and Alyssa Abigail. The researchers were able to determine the current status of indie music's popularity and were able to determine the challenges in promotion, production and distribution. The challenge in production falls on the budget and schedule for they finance their self-produced music by their day jobs. The challenge in promotion and distribution is the lack of media platform aside from social media and music streaming platforms which is free and easy to access by their audiences. The researchers concluded that Pinoy indie music is surviving and building it's own part in the music scene with the help of social media sites such as facebook and music streaming apps such as spotify and soundcloud as their platform in the music distribution and promotion process. In the past few years, there were events, shows and other performance venue that gave opportunities to indie musicians to showcase their music such as UP Fair Fest, Fete De la Musique, and Rakrakan Festival: Pinoy Muna that made a stage especially for indie musicians.

These characteristics made the country as one of the tourist destinations in the world. The number of tourists in the Philippines is increasing. As a result, the Department of Tourism is expanding its efforts to further improve and maintain the places and cultural heritages. The National Tourism Development Plan is one of 'the efforts that the department made for the areas of improvement of each places inside the country for a better tourism opportunities. Tourism is one of the main sectors that contributes to the economic growth and is still developing. Its importance is vital to the life of nations because of its immediate effects on the social, cultural, educational and economic sectors of national societies and international relations. Tourism development plan is a necessary tool in an effective tourism. It is also essential for the growth of economy, poverty reduction and for the conservation of natural and cultural resources because together with tourism are these factors that can be affected. Communication has a big role in sustaining and managing tourism dimensions. A well thought of communication material or plan is the answer for a successful tourism. Many of the places in the NTDP shows that there is a need to improve in the public-sector coordination and governance in terms of tourism, and one of those is the province of Pompano. As center of the city, San Fernando has a lot of potential in improving its tourism. Its diverse characteristics is an opportunity for the improvement in the field of tourism, but what's lacking is a plan--- a plan that will further help the city grow its attraction, a plan that will make the happenings inside the city look as one arid a plan that will strengthen the city's goal to be the Christmas Capital of the Philippines, be achieved. This research is intended to boost the tourism in Pampanga through a PR Campaign. Data will be gathered by assessing the communication tools used by the City Tourism Office and the City Information Office of San Fernando. The communication tools were assessed in three factors (1) the level of awareness of the tourists to the communication tools (2) the level of receptiveness of the tourists toward the communication tools and (3) the level of engagement of the tourists in San Fernando. Based on the survey, the level of awareness of the tourists to the communication tools are high. They mostly knew about the city through word of mouth from family, friends, and acquaintances and through the influence of Social Networking Sites such as Facebook. The level of receptiveness of the tourists toward the communication tools was measured on the frequency of tourists who have seen, heard and read about the communication tools- the result shows that the receptiveness of the tourists are high, as most of them have already been to the city and are looking forward to going back. The level of engagement of the tourists in San Fernando reveals that the Giant Lantern Festival is the most participated and anticipated event in the city. The recommendations were based from these data. A PR Plan was proposed by the researchers to address the underutilization of the communication tools in promoting the tourism in the city. The plan will be composed of events, local festivals and activities that are aimed to highlight the city as 'Home of the Giant Lanterns"". In the proposed strategies and tactics., the researchers have highlighted the importance and influence of Social Media in engaging the target audience, lcularly Filipino Millennials to visit the city.

Descriptive research design using the quantitative-qualitative approach was done in the study through surveys to buyers and in-depth interviews with key informants from the local footwear owners and sellers in Liliw, the Liliw municipal government officials, and the experts and practitioners in the field. Based on buyers' perspective, 'very high to high' level of awareness and effectiveness with regards to the promotional efforts and initiatives for the Liliw footwear industry has been observed. This finding was primarily attributed to the strong historical and reputational image of Liliw into cheap yet durable footwear products which persisted through decades. As per local footwear businesses in Liliw, large enterprises are generally more aware and more participative to the promotional efforts for the industry than the small enterprises. Most small enterprises rarely participate as they experience low production counts and limited stocks as their usual problems in joining promotions, saying Liliw still does not have the capacity to acquire the title, 'Footwear Capital of Laguna' as the town needs to address its current problems in supply and production processing plus the issues on stakeholder unification and internal industry communications. In terms of industry challenges, Liliw is still a 'backyard industry' with `traditionalist' footwear owners as industry movers. There are even no means of standardization on pricing and design due to the absence of a footwear federation. Through the years, the industry fails to create a footwear association due to the `competitors' mentality which persisted among local footwear owners through the years and their 'rough' relationship with the municipal government. As per findings supported by the experts, Liliw footwear industry needs to establish a mechanism that will encourage and unite all industry stakeholders to take part in a united industry promotions and devise continuous and measurable promotional efforts year-round to reduce 'off-seasons' on sales that will target all markets for the long-term development and survival of the industry. With unification, relationship-building and community engagement as key factors for industry's success, a year-long public relations plan has been proposed to promote the Liliw footwear industry. "

50,book_pic/image.jpg,HearSay: An Android Mobile Application for the Hard of Hearing and Deaf-Mute People ,"Dayrit, Ramon Aaron E., Tropel Rosemarie T. ",March ,2017,College of Engineering and Technology ,Bachelor of Science in Information Technology ,Undergraduate,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are about 360 million people (5% of total population) in the world with a hearing loss classified as severe or greater (hearing loss of 40dB or more). The majority of these live in a developing country. The actual percentage of deaf people probably varies in different countries; external factors such as disease, accidents and environmental influences cause at least 50% of all hearing loss and are more likely to occur in developing countries. Due to complex individual and systematic factors, deaf and hard of hearing individuals often receive inadequate and inappropriate communication which results to wrong perspective from other people.  This mobile application will provide a way to make a deaf-mute / hard of hearing person able to receive sound signals from his environment through his mobile phone. Also, this mobile application will include a chat box feature to help them communicate with other people. This will also help deaf-mute / hard of hearing people in travelling, by guiding them until they reach their destination. Objective: To provide the hard of hearing people / deaf-mute an application that will help them communicate with a non-deaf person, face-to-face, so that both of them would easily understand each other. To create a channel for the hard of hearing people / deaf-mute to receive sound signals from their environment by activating their phone's microphone that will receive the sound signals, and in return, will alert them through visuals if a known loud sound was detected. To give the hard of hearing people / deaf-mute an application that will assist them in reaching new and unfamiliar places by providing an offline map that can save previous marked locations for future use. Conclusion:Based on the related literatures and results of the survey, the researchers conclude that: a. Hard of hearing and deaf people are challenged when it conies to communication. These challenges affect most of the time their social and emotional state. This could lead to mental disorders like depression. b.During emergency situations like fire, deaf people have no means to receive the sound signal the fire alarm gives off, thus making them very vulnerable to it. They also would miss most calls from their family and friends, unless they are using a phone specifically designed for them. c.Transportation is another challenge deaf people face, especially when going to a new place. Communication between hearing people would be hard and giving directions would be difficult for a hearing person to give to a deaf person. This could lead to the deaf person being lost in a place they are not familiar with. Process: The process model the researchers followed in this study is the Agile Model. This model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product. The following are the principles of Agile Model: 1. Individuals and interactions - In agile development, self-organization and motivation are important, as are interactions like co-location and pair programming. 2. Working software - Demo working software is considered the best means of communication with the customer to understand their requirement, instead of just depending on documentation. 3.Customer collaboration - As the requirements cannot be gathered completely in the beginning of the project due to various factors, continuous customer interaction is very important to get proper product requirements. 4. Responding to change - Agile development is focused on quick responses to change and continuous development. The researchers agreed that this model would best suit this study since the requirements are prone to change, gives flexibility to the developer, and the project is short. Recommendation: The researchers would like to recommend the following for the future researchers: a. Give the deaf person an option or a tool to look up the meaning of a word during conversation or to hasten the searching the meaning. Deaf people have a difficulty in phonemic decoding when dealing with new words. b. Create an automatic contact system so when an emergency alarm was detected, the family of the deaf person would also be alerted of the emergency. This could be important when the deaf person's family is away. c. Connect the application to a tracking system so that the family of deaf person can monitor him during travel. This could useful if and when the deaf person is lost in a new place. "

62,book_pic/image.jpg,Acid-dent: A research study that helps Filipino fishermen to measure and identify the acidity of Philippine seawater,"Avila, Henderson F., Muring, Leo Dominic D. ",March ,2017,College of Engineering and Technology ,Bachelor of Science in Information Technology ,Undergraduate,"Ocean Acidification is a growing issue for the global community including the Philippines, one reason behind this is because seafood is one of the necessities of the Filipino household. Its effect will be felt very much by the consumers of seafood, sometimes a specific type of seafood will not be available due to scarcity of catching the said seafood. These incidents can be problematic for both the fishermen who have nothing to catch and will lose their primary and only source of income and to the consumer that will lose variety in selecting seafood. The fishermen do not have a device that can help them identify whether the local seawater' acidity level is higher than normal. Early detection of high acidity can help fishermen adapt to the changes brought by Ocean Acidification and can enable fishermen continue to thrive in spite of the growing problem of Ocean Acidification. News about Ocean Acidification does not spread very fast to the authorities, thus the fishermen's catch will decrease due to lack of help from the local Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources that could help them tackle the problem with Ocean Acidification. The fishermen are not capable of purchasing devices that can help them determine the acidity of local seawater, which greatly decreases their effort to counter the negative effects of Ocean Acidification that will decrease their catch of fish. As these problems contribute greatly to the study of Ocean Acidification, the researchers have developed a device that will measure and identify the ocean acidity levels of local seawater. The study also aims to equip local fishermen with the device from the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to monitor local seawater against Ocean Acidification. The study will also send a short-message as notification to the user when high acidity is detected. Objective: The general objective of this study is to develop a device which will measure and identify the ocean acidity levels of local seawater and provide fast and useful information about Ocean Acidification to the Filipino fishermen and the BFAR. Specifically, this study is aimed to: I . To develop an Application for the Filipino fisherman that can measure and identifyacidity in Philippine seawater. 2. To create an Application using Arduino device that will help the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in cost cutting and support Filipino fishermen in monitoring the acidity of seawater without spending money. 3. To create an Application which can quickly provide notification via through mobile application for Filipino fishermen and to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources when there is high acidity level incident/occurrence. Conclusion: First, fishermen have no device that can measure the high levels of acidity in local seawater, which can be dangerous to the environment and to their income if not detected. This device is intended to provide the fishermen capability to quickly determine if the local seawater is highly acidic. The second problem is that the fishermen cannot purchase devices that can determine the acidity of local seawater which can affect their source of income. The fishermen can help protect the environment from ocean acidification and their source of income at the same time. Manual notification is ineffective when there is detection/occurrence of high acidity in local seawater. This device is supported by a mobile application that will alert the website operator on the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources about the readings of the device used by fishermen. "

143,book_pic/image.jpg,A Correlational Study on Paternal Love Language and Resilience among Graduating Students of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila,"Sunio, Janela Tanya P.",October,2018,College of Science,Bachelor of Science in Psychology,Undergraduate,"Parents have the fundamental responsibility of raising and rearing their children. Of all people, they should be the first ones to protect, nurture, and provide love for their children, for them to grow and develop healthily. The main purpose of this study was to figure out which category of parental love language is associated to resilience the most. To accomplish this, graduating students from chosen colleges of Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila were asked to answer two questionnaires that measure resilience and parental love language, respectively. After gathering data, Pearson's r was utilized to determine the relationship of the two variables. Results indicated that there is a strong positive correlation between resilience and parental love language (r — 0.686, N =120, p < 0.01). Whereas, the category that is associated most to resilience is Quality Time (r = 0.702, N =120, p < 0.01). This signifies that parents who are present, set aside other activities to spend time, and make the effort to togetherness tend to raise more resilient adolescents. "

'Suha' Leaf Crude Extract Using Prothrombin Time Assay,"Brillo, Samuel C.",March,2017,College of Science,Bachelor of Science in Biology,Undergraduate,"The focus of this study is to evaluate the in vitro anticoagulant potential of Citrus maxima leaf ethanolic crude extract in human plasma using prothrombin time assay. Three concentrations were formed from the crude extract combined with normal saline solution: 10 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL and 50 mg/mL. Human platelet-poor plasma (PPP) samples were acquired from four male donors, aged 18-21. Untreated PPP samples were used as negative control to confirm normal clotting time (NCT), which is 13-16 seconds. Heparin was used as positive control. PPP samples were treated with the leaf crude extracts of different concentrations and control groups for 3 minutes and determined their clotting time in duplicate tests to record mean clotting time (MCT). Clotting time (CT) was used as parameter in measuring its anticoagulant activity. For statistical treatment, one-way ANOVA was used to determine significant difference among treatments followed by post hoc Tukey's test to identify the most effective concentration. To determine its anticoagulant potential, it was compared to positive control using independent t-test. Based on the results, all treatments exceeded the normal clotting time. There is a progressive trend in CT as the concentration increases. The highest concentration, 50 mg/mL exhibited highest CT (26.087 seconds) and prolonged CT by 77.15%. One-way ANOVA showed that all treatments were significantly different with each other. Post hoc Tukey's test revealed that the most effective concentration is 50 mg/mL. However, according to t-test of heparin vs. 50 mg/mL, there was a significant difference but this implicates that the anticoagulant activity of 50 mg/mL concentration was not as potent as heparin according to t-test. Further studies can be conchicted to assess the anticoagulant activity of the crude extract. "

Although there is limited number of studies concerning this plant, its known phytochemical can help in assuming its anthelminthic activity. The objective of this study is to use this natural herbal plant extracxt in eliminating Ancylostoma caninum for the safety of canines and humans with direct contact to canines and to lessen the economic loss that can cause by diseases brought by this parasite. The leaves of Voacanga globosa were collected from mountainous forest of Bicol region and experimentation proper conducted at Tondo Manila City. Crude extract of the lead was achieved using 95% ethanol. Solvent was removed vio rotary evaporation. Egg of Ancylostoma caninum was collected from feces of a single dog and cultured using Harada Mori Technic. The filariform of Ancylostoma caninum was exposed to different concentrations of the lead extract of Voacanga globosa. Each petri dish contained 100 worms with 10mL of gthe extract. The set up was observed under light microscope after 24, 48, and 72 hours. Results sjowed that V. globosa leaf extract exhibit anthelminthic activity against larvae of A. caninum. This showed 100% immobilize larvae after 24 hours of exposure in different concentrations of crude extract. A One-Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test between positive test and the different concentrations showed no significant difference on their anthelminthic activity (0.713>0.05). This also suggests that longer time exposure to the extract results to higher anthelminthic activity against the parasite."

The M rosenbergii PL-40 were immersed for 3 days in varying concentration of iron oxide: 0.05 mg/L, 0.1 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L and 5.0 mg/L. After immersion, Al. rosenbergii representatives were used to observe histological changes and measure phagocytic activity. Histological tissues were prepared using the paraffin method and stained with hematoxylin-eosin stain. Phagocytic activity, on the other hand, was measured by immersing M. rosenbergii postlarvae representatives to Pseudomonas aeruginosa to induce the phagocytosis. Phagocytic activity (%) was obtained by dividing the phagocytic hemocyte with the total hemocyte, and then multiplied to 100. Results showed that phagocytic activity (36.53% to 44.02%) was found to be higher at concentrations of 0.05 mg/L and 0.1 mg/L iron oxide relative to the control (30.86%). However, at concentrations 1.0 mg/L and 5.0 mg/L, phagocytic activities (13.54% to 24.74%) were found to be lower. This is because iron integrates with iron chelating agent of lysosomal granules, which intensifies the phagocytic activity of M rosenbergii. Further increase of concentration would result to its inhibition due to cellular damage resulting to impaired physiological processes thus the immune response. Hepatopancreatic tissues, parallel with these, were found to have no notable lesions at concentration 0.05 mg/L. However, vacuolization leading to thin lining and increased lacunar space was found at concentrations 0.1 mg/L, 1.0 mg/L and 5.0 mg/L. Gills, on the other hand, did not show apparent lessions that could cause disease to the fish. However, slight changes in gill tips and orientation were found. Thus, this study showed that iron oxide present in small amounts was not harmful to M rosenbergii but could cause minor architectural changes. Furthermore, an increase of iron oxide concentration would cause low phagocytic activity and major changes in tissues. "

Almost all of the running vehicles uses petroleum based fuels fraction from crude oil and other fossil fuels. For an engine to properly function, a lubricant in the form of motor oil is used. Used motor oil is proven to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which can cause genotoxic effects to organisms it could come in contact with. Urban oil contamination is predominantly caused by improper disposal of used oil and runoffs from auto engines. The effects it would incur to a plant growth and development was investigated. Used motor oil was used exclusively as the contaminating agent, with amounts of 50ml, 100ml and 150ml of motor oil per one kilogram of organic grade garden soil. The planting period lasted for about 28 days, after which the germination percentage, germination rate and fresh weight was obtained. Prepared slides from the leaves, roots and stems of seedlings grown on different treatment were examined through histological analysis. Results obtained from the germination percentage, germination rate and fresh weight indicated that there was a direct effect of motor oil contamination, concluding that when the amount of motor oil added on the soil increases there's a significant decrease on the number of seeds germinated and reduced biomass. Measurement of the external structures of the seedling showed that there was an inhibition of growth as shown on the leaves, stems and roots from 50ml, 100ml and 150ml treatments. Examination of the prepared slides revealed that there was an increase information of lignified cells on the tissues obtained from seedlings exposed to increasing amount of motor oil;  thus concluding that motor oil contamination can significantly influence the growth and development of plants it was exposed into.

This study was conducted to detect the presence and identify the prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi infection in the cattle of Silang and Tagaytay Cavite using Blood Smear Technique. Different ages and both genders of the cattle were used for blood collection. 108 cattle were sampled and Tagaytay City and 112 cattle were sampled in silang cavite. Using a sterile needle, blood was collected by puncturing the peripheral vein of the ear of the cattle. The fresh blood was smeared through thick and thin smears then air dried. Thin smears were fixed with methanol. Both smears were stained with Giemsa Stain for 25 minutes and washed after drying. The slides with blood smears were examined under the microscope through H4O (400x) and OIO (1000x). No statistical analysis was performed due to zero percent prevalence of Trypanosoma evansi in the study sites. Out of 108 cattle sampled in Tagaytay city and 112 cattle sampled in silang cavite, the cattle sampled were not contracting Surra infection based on the results of blood smear examinations. This signifies that the areas are still safe for the cattle to occupy. The researcher would like to recommend using sensitive techniques and devices in detecting trypanosoma evansi like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), card agglutination test (CAT) and mouse inoculating task (MIT) especially in tagaytay City and Silang Cavite.

The study was conducted to determine the species present and to compute for the carbon stock of trees in the riverbanks of Marikina City. The Marikina River is a portion of the Pasig River with headwaters located in the Sierra Madre Mountains in Rodriguez, Rizal. From Rodriguez, the river flows through San Mateo, Rizal and then to its namesake Marikina City. The riverbanks of Marikina City are one of the few places left in Metro Manila that contains a large number of trees giving it a great potential in storing carbon. Five different sites of the riverbanks were sampled by identifying the species of tree found and measuring its diameter at breast height (dbh). The tree biomass was computed using Basuki's equation with the result to be used in computing for the tree carbon stock. A default value of 45% for the carbon stored in trees was used. The carbon stock was obtained by multiplying the tree biomass density to 0.45. The species of trees were verified by experts from the Bureau of Plant Industry and National Museum. A dichotomous key for identification of species was constructed by using the morphological characteristics of the trees as basis. A total of 23 species of trees from 16 different families were found in the riverbanks. The average carbon stock of the riverbanks is 32.65 MgC ha-1 with 15 families included in the carbon stock computation following the parameters of the study.

Menudo, chicken curry, and pinakbet samples were procured from two food stalls within the university. Menudo and chicken curry samples were collected from. Stall 1 while pinakbet sample was from Stall 2. The samples were homogenized aseptically and analyzed for the Aerobic Plate Count (APC), Most Probable Number (MPN), and isolation of enteric bacteria. Gram staining and biochemical tests were used to give the presumable identity of the bacterial isolates. A total of 38 isolates were obtained from the three food samples. From these isolates, there were 3 species identified: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes. All the species isolated were present in all the food samples. Pinakbet had the highest colony forming units per gram (a-Leg) with an average of 3.0 x10? cfu/g, followed by menudo with 2.3 x10? cfu/g, and the Ieast, chicken curry with 2.0 x10? cfu/g. In terms of Most Probable Number per grain/milliliter (MPN/g/ml), pinakbet was still the highest with an average of 15.2 MPN/g/ml, followed by menudo with an average of 10.2 MPN/g/ml, and the least, chicken curry with an average of 6.16 MPN/g/ml. The bacterial density among the three samples showed significant difference in terms of cfu/g. The factors related to the contamination of the food were the unsanitary location of the stalls, unhygienic storing, and unsafe handling of foods. "

Consent form was presented .to cattle owners during blood collection. Blood was collected from the peripheral vein in the ear of the cattle. Fixation of thin blood smears was immediately done using methanol. Giemsa Stain was used in staining the blood smears. The total sample size was 38 cattle in each municipality. A total of 152 blood smears were subjected to microscopic examination (1000x) in detecting the presence of Trypanosoma evansi. After several microscopic observations, however, there was no presence of Trypanosoma evansi all of the slides examined. This negative result suggests that there is a zero prevalence rate in Maragondon and Magallanes. Since there are no prevalence rates that can be used for comparison, the statistical analysis was not performed. The negative result might be due to low sensitivity of diagnostic method used and low sample size. "

The antifungal potential of Anuang (Kyllinga monocephala) rhizome and roots crude extract was screened using Paper Disc Diffusion, a qualitative assay in which presence of zones of inhibition were noted. On the other hand, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, a quantitative assay using two-fold serial dilution was determined by visually examining the wells. To confirm the results of the serial dilution method, the contents of the potential Minimum Inhibitory Concentration wells were streaked on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar plates where Minimum Fungicidal Concentration were observed. The crude extract of Anuang did not exhibited an antifungal activity against T. rubrum. No zone of inhibition were obseved after the incubation period, therefore the test organism has shown resistance to antifungal agents of the plant extract. Then, the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of the test plant, Anuang, was exhibited at 1000 mg/ml concentration while the positive control (Piper belle) at 31.3 mg/ml concentration. So, the positive control exhibited a higher antifungal activity than the test plant. Hence, the MFC revealed that the presumptive MICs were accurate through the streaked SDA plates. Thus, it can be explained that the positive control is still better at inhibiting fungal growth than the tested plant extract. "

Angiogenesis must be maintained in optimal amounts. Too much or less amount of blood vessel may lead to diseases and complications such as tumors. The researcher used chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to demonstrate the inhibition of blood vessel formation with the use of Pseudelephantopus spicatus plant extract. This research focused on the angiogenic activity of P. spicatus plant extract of varying concentrations (84.75, 63.75, 42.75, and 21.19mg/ml) compared to Camellia sinensis which served as the positive control, while ethanol served as the negative control in this experiment. The extracts were applied on the eight day of incubation and were observed two days after the application. The angiogenic inhibition was assessed according to three different criteria: vessel density, vessel length, and branching point. Results showed that 84.75 mg/ml of P spicatus showed the highest percent inhibition (25.91%). The inhibition recorded was dose dependent with the highest concentration being at the top of the list. Wide range of effectivity was observed depending on the concentration used. No significant difference was noted between 84.75 mg/ml and the positive control (p=0.014, 0.005< 0.050). Generally speaking, the positive control and the 84.75 mg/ml of P. spicatusare of the same level of effectivity. No significant difference was also calculated within the varying concentrations of the treatment group making all the concentrations of equal effectivity (p=0.581, 0.561<0.050). These results imply that P. spicatus could be a source of anti-angiogenic compounds and can be studied further. "

These systems are created to help improve user access and handle information overload with the main purpose of finding relevant and related items to create suggestions to the users. One method that may be used are clustering algorithms. ROCK clustering algorithm is known for being able to cluster categorical data using links. However, data in the web will not always be categorical. There will be instances wherein numerical data will be processed or hybrid data sets. With that, this study aims to enhance the ROCK clustering algorithm to be able to handle both types of data be applying another similarity measure, Hamming distance. Additionally, by implementing thresholds, to help in the merging process, the time complexity of the algorithm may be decreased which can help it in handling large data sets. Lastly, thresholds were used to improve the merging decision which initially was solely based on the number of links per data. To further enhance the algorithm, other similarity measures may be used, depending on the characteristics of the data sets to be processed. An alternative process may be implemented in creating merging decisions to eliminate overlaps in the clusters, and the merging process of the algorithm may further be improved using a different merging process to decrease its time complexity."

",March,2019,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Spell checkers help the people who write to analyze incorrect spelling of words and provide the most possible correct word. Double Metaphone Algorithm is believed to be the best fit for spell checker. There were three problems that arise in this study. First is that the Double Metaphone algorithm transforms all initial vowels to “A” thus providing incorrect matches for words starting with other vowels. This problem was solved by creating a specific code for each other initial vowel. Syllabification rules were followed to help obtain the first objective by disregarding the diphthongs in the initial position for ore letters in the latter part of a word to be taken into consideration. Another problem is that the algorithm eliminates letters “y” and “w” for it always treats letter y as a vowel and in some cases the letter “w” resulting to a limited code. The objective in this problem is to make the algorithm be able to take “w” and “y” into consideration by The Doubling Up Rule. The last problem is that the algorithm does not provide a same letter code to consonants “b”, “d”, “g” and “v” resulting to unnecessary matches. The solution used for this problem is to provide a corresponding letter code for words containing “b”, “d”, “g” and “v” that follows the English Phonemic Transcription Key. After applying these solutions, the algorithm improved it’s efficiency by giving more precise search results. The researchers recommend that a longer generated code for better results should be done."

In this research, the proponents enhanced the Simple Naïve Algorithm that is used in extractive text summarization by modifying the algorithm based on the test results. The study found out that existing algorithm treats other punctuation marks between spaces as a word, affecting the computation of the sentence score. To make it more accurate and have a better score, we apply the process of disregarding of punctuations between spaces that will result to a better summarized output and sentence scores. It also found out that the existing algorithm reads contracted differently from the expanded form of the words resulting to different sentence scores, so we apply a data dictionary to the system to determine the contracted word and its expanded form as one. And lastly, the existing algorithm treats other punctuation marks at the end of the word as part of the word which can lead to incorrect sentence intersections, so we took consideration to apply delimiters at the end of the word to determine the punctuation marks at the end and it will be removed from the word.

",March,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"The popularity of video games in recent years has made an impact to society on what the media can do to people. But video games are not fun and games as they make it appear to be, problems persist as early as the media was created. One problem is how the AI (Artificial Intelligence) find the path from start to goal. The study is to help figure out a way to solve this problem through the enhancement of the pathfinding algorithm called HPA*. A game was developed by the researchers to identify and solve the problems found on the pathfinding algorithm and applied an enhancement on the algorithm to solve the problems. Through this process, it was found that the algorithm is still lacking the ability to find a path when encountering dynamic, and non-rectangular obstacles. This was resolved by applying navmesh for scanning the obstacles the unit may encounter. Pathfinding is important to a game because just from its performance, the player’s experience from playing the game will change."

",March ,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Barcode Localization is an extremely important task in Barcode Reading system, which depends highly on image conditions and image processing method it uses. Barcode Localization algorithm uses adaptive thresholding for image smoothing and canny edge detection to locate the lines to be binarized. However, the latter methods can't be applied in some barcode images like barcodes with wrong color combination (light to light or dark to dark) and barcodes that violate the quiet zone. In this study, we present enhanced method using different algorithm to solve the said limitations of the existing algorithm. We used Luminosity method because it produces more distinctive result and we used line detection algorithm to isolate the texts in quiet zones of the barcode with the actual barcode lines. The said methods produce more efficient output than the existing algorithm. "

",March ,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a technology that allows you to convert various types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDF file, or pictures captured by any type of camera into an editable and searchable data. It is broadly used as a form of data entry from any sort of original paper data source, whether school or business documents, receipts, mails, passport documents, or any printed records. It is a usual way of digitalizing printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed online, and used in machine processes such as text-to-speech, text mining, machine translation, etc. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, computer vision, and artificial intelligence. Almost close to perfection, but Optical Character Recognition still has its flaws. This led the researchers do some further enhancements on the said algorithm mainly: Unable to recognize some ASCII Characters, unable to recognize properly-aligned slanted words, and, unable to convert exponents and subscripts accurately. The researchers used survey method for the gathering of data for us to know the user’s view about OCR. The researchers recommend people to use the further enhanced application, but, if users still experience some drawbacks, feel free to improve the algorithm for the benefit of other users."

",March ,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Neural Networks (NN) are important data mining tools used for classification and clustering. It is an attempt to build machines that can mimic brain activities and be able to learn. NN usually learns by examples. If a NN is supplied with enough examples, it should be able to perform classification and even discover new trends or patterns in data. Basic NN are composed of three layers - input, output and hidden layers. Each layer can have a number of nodes and nodes from the input layer are connected to the nodes of the hidden layer. Nodes from hidden layer are connected to the nodes from output layer. Those connections represent weights between nodes. This paper describes one of most popular NN algorithms, the Backpropagation (BP) Algorithm. The aim is to enhance this algorithm to make it more efficient in terms of speed and accuracy in training by applying new methods in weight adjustment and adding new variables and functions to regularize weight update and to improve the error rate detection to produce more reliable outputs. The idea behind BP algorithm is quite simple: output of the NN is evaluated against the desired output. If the results are not satisfactory, the connection (weights) between layers are modified and the process is repeated until the error margin is small enough. Simple BP examples are demonstrated in this paper with NN architecture also covered. The algorithm will also be applied to an Intelligent Personal Assistant Development Platform that can be used by developers and enthusiasts alike to develop their own smart agents. The platform will provide users the core components of an IPA: Speech to Text, Intent Recognition and Text to Speech, and at the same time serve as a medium for seamless integration of web services and as a conduit for devices in the ever-growing Internet of Things."

These spam mails may contain malicious words or attachment, links that redirects you to an unwanted website, and some links contain viruses that can harm your computer without even knowing it. These are threats to users, spammers can get information just by simply opening the mail they sent. This research paper presents a variation of token to consider that may use in filtering and number of token to test. This will be beneficial to all who’s using the email to send messages, these may prevent the user in having unnecessary files and viruses attached to the email. We have done manual simulations and computerized simulation to know the possible result of mail stricter. The Paul Graham’s Bayesian algorithm is a machine learning algorithm that trains and classifies a data or a token with different score, we therefore conclude that considering HTML tags and multiple word as token use to determine whether it is from a spam ail or non-spam mail is much effective. In applying this algorithm to spam filtering stricter, we can distinguish whether our received mail is a spam or not."

Nowadays, different data, information or documents are being sent everywhere. Through time, different techniques in securing private data have been used such as encryption, having password and Steganography. Steganography is about hiding a secret message within an ordinary medium and the extraction of it at its destination. Steganography has 3 types. The Text Steganography which hides the message inside a text, Audio Steganography which hides the message inside an audio file and Image Steganography which hides the message inside an image. This study is focused on the Image Steganography and based on the study “An Enhancement of Steganography Algorithm to hide Secret Message inside an Image” by Kenneth M. Carolino and Robin V. Sombilon (2016). The former researchers noted that the study is open for enhancement. By simulating the algorithm and analyzing the last researcher’s recommendation, we found several problems on the existing algorithm. First, some of the important ASCII Characters are not recognized by the algorithm. The next one is other languages with different character structure were not accepted by the algorithm so it turns out that the encrypted message does not decrypts the whole text message. Lastly, the algorithm fails to append another message in a single image. By the given problem, the aim of the further enhanced algorithm of this study is to decrypt and maintain the whole text being encrypted inside the image, to allow the user to input another character structure aside from ASCII and to allow the user to append messages into an existing encrypted message inside a single image."

",March,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"A well-known professional social networking site LinkedIn was breached in 2012 with a revealed 6.5 million user accounts compromised. It was reported that LinkedIn utilized a technique called SHA-1 in storing users’ passwords. SHA-1 is a famous cryptographic hash function hash given by the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST). For this reason, the researchers studied and searched for the best solutions that will improve SHA-1’s security. This paper then presents an Enhanced Secure Hash Algorithm-1. Computer Scientists have found collision attacks on SHA-1 hash function. To overcome this threat, the weak points of its protocols were evaluated. To increase its security, the researchers increased the chaining variable by one more variable. Due to this change, message digest generated is of 192 bits. Hashing, when used in security need to be slow. This is the reason why the computation speed of modified SHA-1 was also enhanced in this study. This algorithm has been designed to satisfy the different level of enhanced security and to resist the advanced SHA attacks. These attacks include brute force attack, rainbow tables, and lookup tables. The researchers added a salt that is cryptographically random to prevent these attacks. This way no two identical passwords will have the same hash. In addition, this paper also discussed the construction of the algorithm in detail and compared its strengths and weaknesses to the old one given by NIST."

And to provide a powerful search engine to PLM, given that this study will be applied in PLM RMS which can ease the access and retrieval of the important documents from thousands of entries in the archive. In order to achieve our goal we must solve the following problems: exact string search, ranking or retrieved files, and giving priority to the results where multiple hits occurred. Inverse Indexing Algorithm is an algorithm that utilizes an inverse index data structure for information search and retrieval. In an inverse index structure, each words holds indexes of all the documents where the word occurs. These words are the ones being parsed by the algorithm and compared to the query tokens. We improved the inverse indexing algorithm by adding enhanced stemming process in which help us to further utilize the searching capacity of our study. We also added statistical ranking and hierarchy level of priorities. And by thorough observation we found out the solution on each of the problem in the existing algorithm, which resulted to solving all the problems that we encounter, but still, enhancement would be much considered. Now our enhanced inverse indexing algorithm (Zner-Ecniv) can be applied to different document management systems specifically to PLM Record Management System, and also to IOS/Android search applications."

These factors can greatly affect the result of the recognition that can lower the accuracy of the algorithm. Such factors are; First, the variances in each image’s lighting condition; Second, the PCA’s Dimension Reduction that causes the processing level to increase significantly high; and Third, the susceptibility to recognize a person even when not yet registered into the system. In this study, our goal is to explore these issues in a mathematical manner and propose procedures to enhance the algorithm while still maintaining, or even improve, its efficiency as much as possible. We have tested and simulated the original algorithm and found that accuracy of Eigenface depends on many things. First problem, the accuracy would be greatly affected by varying light intensity. We applied a method where the input image’s light settings will be automatically adjusted before recognition occurs thus making the algorithm adaptive to various lighting environment settings. Second problem, the system recognizes an input even if doesn’t exist in the system. We have applied a common threshold before comparing eigenface to avoid false recognition. Third problem, using Dimension Reduction, the computation of the covariance matrix can significantly heighten process levels. We have devised a method where the number of trained faces M is compared from the squared of the size of the image N2 before continuing with the computation selecting the best computation available."

Makiling. Furthermore, this study aimed to answer which specific treatment displayed best results in repelling C. meyeri leeches. Five treatments were used in this experiment, of which four of the treatments have varying concentrations (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) of peppermint (M. piperita) oil and a negative control treatment with 10 trials each treatment. Each trial was observed for 10 minutes only. Each leech crossing was defined as either failed or successful to determine the repellent effect of peppermint (M. piperita). Results revealed that as the concentration of peppermint (M. piperita) increased, the number of failed crossings increased indicating the repellent effect of the oil. The treatment that exhibited the best results based on the number of failed crossings and statistically significantly different compared to other treatments was Treatment E (100% peppermint oil)."

However, there are doubtful ""Class A"" or replicas of these expensive goods sold at a very low price in numerous stalls in the metro. In addition, these stalls have no license from the make up companies that manufactures the brands that they sell. This study evaluated the microbial quality of counterfeit cosmetics sold in Manila. Twelve samples of two different variants and two different brands of counterfeit cosmetic samples were microbiologically evaluated in this study. Samples were collected from random local flea markets within Manila area. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were done to evaluate the samples. Plate counts were observed to assess if the microbial population within the products would pass the ASEAN Guidelines on Microbiological Limit in Cosmetic Products (2007). Samples were also subjected to several selective media for the detection of specified aerobic microorganisms set by ASEAN and United States Pharmacopeia. Seventy-five percent of the total samples yielded one or more of the target microorganisms in this study. The pathogenuc contaminants namely, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella sp. were present in one or more of the tested cosmetic samples. Fungal colonies were also present, however, none of the samples was contaminated with Candida albicans. P aeruginosa and Salmonella were the most frequently occuring bacteria among the samples. S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. colo were more commonly found on mascaras. P. aeruginosa is expected to be more common in eye area cosmetics due to previous known cases of ocular diseases associated with the said pathogen. Salmonella sp., a bacterial agent causing food poisoning, was surprisingly detected in some of the lipcream samples. Furthermore, in terms of quantitative analysis, all of the samples exceeded the limits set by ASEAN."

Four stalls were the source of the three sandwich spread samples. Each store was assessed thru the prepared risk factor evaluation form. Sample homogenate was aaseptically prepared and analyzed for the aerobix plate count, enumeration of coliforms and Escherichia coli and isolation of Salmonella. Gram staining and seven biochemical testing were undertaken to give the presumptive identity of isolated colonies. A total of 19 isolates belonging to 6 genera were identified. Serratia Providencia, Enterobacter, Escherichia, Salmonella and Edwardsiella. In peanut butter and chocolate spread, Serratia sp. had the highest percentage of occurence, 50% and 33% respectively. Whereas, Serratia sp. and Enterobacter sp. were the most commonly found genera isolate detected with 40% occurence each. Peanut butter had the highest CFU/ml with an average of 2.6x10? CFU/ml. Followed by chicken spread with an average of 1.86x10? CFR/ml. Chocolate spread had an average of 1.75x10? CFU/ml. The bacterial count among the three selected sandwich spread samples showed no significant difference in terms of CFU/ml. factors related to high bacterial densities were an unapproved source of products, containers lids that were not tightly fitted; unrefrigirated products and store's area had insects and rodents' infestation. All three-sandwich spread has exceeded and failed to meet the standard bacterial count implemented by FDA. Also, the occurence of E. coli and Salmonella sp. implies the likelihood of a microbial hazard and fecal contamination. Thus, the data obtained in this study indicate that the selected sandwihc spreads were unsafe and could be a possible source of foodborne illness and must be addresses and monitored by the authorities."

This paper aims to examine the conflict in managing and maximizing the resources and profit of a business with the least amount of expenses incurred throughout its operation. Researchers could say that one of the methods that could help businesses achieve such objective is to leverage its resources, specifically its people, technology and capital. The concept of leveraging the capital of a business would not be a complete success without its human and technology strategic methods. Based on how a company finances its operation, leverage is a tool that creates the opportunity to be more profitable in the long-term."

Through the purpose of this study to determine the predominant level of academic performance of the PLM CPA Licensure Examination takers for each of the board subjects in their academic grades and to know its significant relationship to their board performance, the researchers utilized the correlational method wherein secondary data gathered were evaluated. Simple random sampling resulting to 159 sample was used in assessing the representation from the whole population of 263 PLM board takers. The results show that the board takers have very satisfactory level in the subjects Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), Advanced Financial Accounting and Reporting (AFAR), Management Advisory Services (MAS) and Business Law and Taxation (BLT) with only satisfactory level in Auditing (AUD), Further, the board rating of the takers used to measure their board performance, revealed that in all of the subjects in the board, they performed poorly. Moreover, the results identified that significant relationship exists between the academic performance of the PLM CPA Licensure Examination takers and their board performance in the subjects FAR, AFAR, and BLT with negative and weak correlation implying that as the academic performance increases, board performance decreases, vice versa. However, in the board subjects AUD and MAS, no significant relationship exists between the takers academic and board performance that can be understood that changes in academic grading has no effect at all in the board performance of the takers. Therefore, the researchers recommended that the BS Accountancy students of PLM as well as the College administrators, take into account the importance of the academic performance to successfully prepare themselves for the Board Examination."

The researchers assessed the respondents' knowledge on basic financial concepts through adapting eight (8) questions from different standardized tests and correlated the scores from such to the data collected from the attitude test which involves identifying the response of the respondents to different hypothetical situations related to spending and savings. A survey questionnaire was used to assess eighty-two (82) students from the aforementioned degree program. By using the Pearson Product-Moment of Correlation, the financial knowledge scores of the said students are reckoned to correlate to their behavioral tendencies, with a positive relationship between the independent and dependent variables. Therefore, as the respondents' score increases, the more they demonstrate positive behavioral tendencies toward spending and savings. A positive pattern of the respondents' behavioral tendencies as an impact of their high to above average basic financial knowledge level can infer that the understanding of fourth-year PLM BSA students to concepts of financial management and finance, in general, assists in the development and positive reinforcement of their perception on different financial matters.

Catandala, then drop off when you see the big farm sign ""Chick-Inn"". DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS: Chick-Inn is a broiler contract growing business situated at Brgy. Catandala, Batangas City, Batangas. This project was carried out to promote agriculture industry and to help meet the growing demand of broiler raising services of commercial integrators due to the growing demand of broiler meat in the market. Contract growing is a venture, wherein an agricultural production is carried out based on an agreement by two contracting parties, the poultry farmer and the contracting commercial integrator (Minot, 2007). Specifically, in broiler contract growing, the poultry farmer would have the obligation to render a service, in accordance to the provisions of their contract, of raising quality broilers preferably Cobb, provided by the commercial integrator, in its own houses and facilities. Feeds, technical assistance, medications, vaccines, and other products or services needed to carry out the operation are also provided by the integrator. On the other hand, the grower provides the land, broiler houses, support facilities, labor, equipment, maintenance and proper farm management to ensure the maximum efficiency of the business operations. According to Silva (2005), the practice of contract growing was traced back to nineteenth century when it was used to cultivate crops and animals, and up to now, people who engage in this kind of venture take advantage of its benefits. For farmers, the risks on production and marketing are reduced, since the inputs and needed assistance are provided by the integrators, which results in stability in revenues. On the other hand, this kind of business is also favorable to the integrators as it ensures greater regularity of agricultural products. Project's Long-Range Objectives: The proposed venture values the ""going-concern"" concept of accounting where it visualizes itself as a business that will continue to exist for a Long-term. Improvements of equipment, systems, and facilities are among the priorities of the business' long-term goal. Chick in firmly assures its ability to adapt to new technological advancements with regard to poultry farming. Chick-Inn also wants to unceasingly improve its strategies and policies to maximize all the resources and efforts that lead to the achievement of the goals of the business. Chick-Inn. having a fixed range of income will not settle to be stagnant; it still aims to continuously improve its financial stability. The business' long-term objectives include an expansion of site and building more broiler houses. The business just initially constructed two broiler houses that are solely intended for broiler raising. These houses are deemed enough to maximize the land area of the business location and could carry 72,000 up to 76,000 birds per batch. Given the fact that poultry contract growing can only incur financial losses with the smallest probability, the expansion of site is certainly a boom for its financial growth. Developing a wider market is considered to be a mission of the business as well. The Chick-inn sees itself as a big and a well-known poultry contract grower, not only in Batangas City but in the whole country as well. In this case, the business would open its doors to investors who would become its channel to additional capital and equity. The business will also establish charity works and will engage itself in corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the future. Helping small poultry farmers will be one of its long-term goals and will become the tail of the business as long as it exists. HIGHLIGHT OF PROJECT: The business is located at Brgy. Catandala, Batangas City with a land area of 1.58 hectares. Chick-Inn complied with the requirements of the three major commercial integrators namely, San Miguel Foods Inc., Bounty Fresh Foods Inc. and Vitarich Corporation. The total project cost amounted to PhP 26,000,000.00 financed by bank loan and capital contributions of the business partners. The company has two (2) tunnel ventilated broiler houses that can contain 72,000 up to 76,000 chickens, and other support facilities that help in business operations. The commercial integrators supply the day-old chicks to be reared by the grower and the grower will pay for the services depending on the efficiency of the company. One of the advantages of poultry contract growing business is that the income is stable even though the market price and demand of the product in the market is changing since the payment will depend on the scheme in the contract that both parties have agreed to.

Marketing Aspect Chick-Inn is a contract growing business to be situated in Brgy. Catandala, Batangas City. Batangas, the target markets of the business are the top performing broiler commercial integrators namely. San Miguel Foods Inc., Vitarich Corporation. and Bounty Fresh Foods Inc. The channel of distribution to be used by the company is direct distribution, wherein service would be provided directly to the consumers without the help of intermediaries. As for the analysis of demand and supply, the offered service has a very high demand according to the commercial integrators involved in this study due to the growing population and demand for chicken meat. Also, the demand. supply and prices of the services will not be affected by the demand, supply and prices of chicken meat in the market since this business will operate in accordance to the specified terms, conditions and payment scheme of the contract. Chick-Inn should adopt the best practices and must operate in its best and most efficient way to earn higher returns. Technical Aspect: The technical aspect of the business focuses merely on the skeletal structure of the project. The Chick-inn Company will be maximizing the capacity of the land that is to be invested by one of its partners. This land is a 1.58-hectare agricultural land situated at Brgy. Catandala, Batangas City, Batangas. The location of the business was guaranteed to be at least 1 km away from the residential areas to avoid any disturbance to residents or any conflict caused by poultry raising. The road structure from the main road of Catandala to the business site itself has a well-developed land which gives the business an easier access to its market. The business will establish two broiler houses that can initially accommodate 36,000 chicks each. The business site isdivided into two parts, the operational part and the administrative area. This partition is divided through establishment of bio-security fences for health and restriction purposes. Roads along the business site are also built for purpose. They are technically established for business operation. It was guaranteed that 10-wheeler trucks can pass through the site specifically to the warehouses where feeds and supplies are procured, and to the broiler houses where chicks are placed off and where fully-grown chickens are harvested. Included in the plant layout are the waste water facility, powerhouse and water tanks that are deemed necessary for poultry raising. Financial Aspect: One of the partners of Chick-inn will be investing a land that is going to be the main land of the project. This agricultural land covers almost 10% of the capital investment of the said business. 70% of the cost of capital investment will be loaned from BPI since the bank can guarantee up to 70% loan to an agricultural sector. The other 6 partners will be equally investing an amount that can shoulder the remaining 30% cost of capital investment plus the working capital needed for the business to operate. Each partner will be investing an amount of PhP 1,182,187.50. The projection of sales of the business is in accordance with the number of chicks that can be raised in aparticular cycle. In the case of Chick-inn, 72,000 chicks can be accommodated in one cycle. The proponents considered a learning curve system of evaluating the 5 years gross revenue of the project. It is assumed that upon the years of broiler raising, workers and staffs have been gaining enough knowledge about how the business works, which makes the mortality rate of the chicken lesser than that of the starting years. The financial statements prepared by the proponents for thisproject is a 5-year comparative financial statements to further analyze and evaluate the long-term operation of the business. Such statements will be expressed and quantified in Philippine peso. Socio-Economic Aspect: With the rise in technology innovation and product differentiation, broiler contract growing has become in demand on the modem poultry farming, and has played a very important role in mankind by providing food, securing income and generating jobs. Broiler chickens raised by the contract growers have satisfied the basic needs of the integrators' consumers when it comes to food. The said product provides Filipinos with the nutrients that they need in order for their bodies to develop and function. On the other hand, contract growing could also be beneficial to people who plan to engage in this kind of venture. The business is deemed to be profitable and easy to manage as broilers are simpler to raise as it grows faster than any other agricultural produce. Workers employed in this type of service are also benefited, not only through the salaries and wages that they earn, but also on the knowledge regarding poultry production that they gain. Poultry production has been one of the most expansive businesses that carry different impacts on the environment including improvement to farm management, and most particularly in animal waste management. Poultry manure is generally recycled and can be sewed as fertilizers to other farms because it contains considerable amounts of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and other excreted substances such as antibiotics, pathogens and heavy metals which are introduced through feed consumption.

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"In this study, an enhanced algorithm for the traditional pattern matching has been proposed named Kruth, Morris, and Pratt Algorithm. This algorithm is an exact matching algorithm that finds an occurrence of a Pattern in a Text. Pattern searching is an important problem relating on computer science. It can be seen on searching for a given string in notepad, browser or database, pattern searching algorithm are used to show the search results. The researchers find the algorithm the most efficient to its application, DNA Sequencing, by its abilities which are an advantage to other related pattern matching algorithms. The KMP algorithm is independent to the alphabet size, use the notion of border of the string, increases performance, decrease delay and decrease time of comparing. Since a DNA sequence contains only a 4 alphabet size which are A, G, C and T, the algorithm denotes characteristics that is suitable to the application by matching phase. The enhanced algorithm is a modified version of Kruth Morris Pratt algorithm. The researchers recognized KMP algorithm for its commendable characteristics, but in this paper, we proposed an enhancement of the algorithm to make it more effective. The first problem is that the existing algorithm is unable to indicate to what extend a match was found. Second, existing algorithm becomes inaccurate if the Pattern p is preceded by its proper prefix in Text T. And lastly, the existing algorithm becomes slow when Pattern p doesn’t have repeating sub-patterns. The researchers came up with objectives to solve the existing problems. First, by using the backtrack methodology, the enhanced algorithm can find the unrecognized overlapping occurrences of the pattern in the Text. Second, to make the algorithm more accurate even the Pattern is preceded by its proper prefix in the Text by using of prefix table and two pre-conditions in searching pattern with its preceded prefix. And, to improve the algorithm’s running time complexity given that the Pattern has no repeating sub-patterns by using Bitwise XNOR binary operation to process two characters in parallel, to speed up the pattern matching process. As the new algorithm uses the principle of Finite automata which is used by KMP algorithm and Bitwise XNOR operation to speed up the character match, it shows some reasonable performance improvement. Also this new algorithm is easy to implement as it doesn’t require any additional or complex data structure and suitable for DNA sequence search."

",March,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Pacman is a popular arcade game that was released in Japan in May 1980 and the game use an algorithm, the Dijkstra algorithm, which is known to find the shortest path towards its target. In our study, we are going to optimize the Dijkstra algorithm using the jump point search algorithm. The subject of this study is the ghosts that chase Pac-Man during the game and we would investigate the path, the nodes and the time of the ghost as it travels toward its target and applied the jump point search algorithm. The results should be able to help the future researches to understand on how the Dijkstra and Jump Point Search algorithm works. In the methodology, we used, we found that applying the jump point search algorithm in the ghost behavior could minimize the node, reduce the time it travels, and avoid being stuck in the loop. This optimize algorithm could be applied to other games that have the same problem and incorporate it in some applications like that used graphs or maps."

About 87 percent of the 21 million households used electricity based on the statistics from March 2011 to August of the same year. As the country develops, the demand for its energy consumption accelerates, the need for controlling the usage of electricity consumption of the user has risen. The researchers used CHAID algorithm in a mobile application along with a custom-design hardware interface to make decisions and control the appliances for the user. The data processed and analyzed by the algorithm helped the system in maintaining the cost of electricity within the budget of the user.

The algorithm begins with a set of potential solutions known as the “population”, which evolves during the process and generates a more optimal set of solutions. The algorithm is applied most commonly in optimization problems, one of which is the vehicle routing problem, which aims for the shortest route that passes only once through a set of points. Other applications of Genetic Algorithm include image processing, circuit design, and scheduling problems. An enhancement of the existing algorithm was proposed to produce a more effective Genetic Algorithm. During the study, the researchers found three problems: the algorithm’s failure to produce a value equivalent to the optimal solution, its tendency to output invalid solutions, and re-computation of fitness values. The enhanced algorithm is now able to produce optimal solutions with no invalid solutions present and is able to minimize execution time when running the enhanced algorithm. Experimental results show that the enhanced Genetic Algorithm is better and more effective than the current algorithm."

",March,2017,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Microbiological research techniques often rely on accurate determination of colony forming units (CFUs). This is done by spreading the bacteria onto the surface of agar contained within a petri dish. After the incubation period of the bacteria, they would form colonies in which are counted manually or by using an image of the petri dish and use an automated colony counter. One popular automated counter is called the Open CFU software. This software has its own algorithm that uses a combination of image processing techniques and object detection. The Open CFU algorithm detects and counts colonies of bacteria (circular-like) on an image, however, its existing methods fail to execute effectively in determining the count of colonies in a low contrast image, colonies with large radius and multi-colored merging ones. To enhance the algorithm, several methods were used and added to it. A method called Contrast Limiting Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) was added to solve the problem that deals with low contrast colonies. Then a modification of conditions were provided to solve the undetected large colonies and lastly, a K-means clustering technique was used to separate multi-colored and merging colonies in an image. Comparisons of outputs were made after the processes to Open algorithm versus the existing algorithm of Open CFU. Based on the results, the study showed an enhanced and more precise counting of bacteria colonies in an image. There are significant changes in the detection and counting of the colonies with low contrast, having a huge and merging multi-colored ones."

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"As geographic information systems become more and more widely used, an increasing amount of geographical data is general and shared between users. Using geographical data introduces some problems, with URLs containing lengthy coordinates needing to be sent through services with character limits. Finding other nearby locations or establishments have been beneficial to these users in expanding their services. These problems have been solved with the usage of geohash encoding algorithm, using properties of space-filling curves to reduce the multiple dimensions of data, down to a shorter, and unique value. One of the problems of the Geohash encoding algorithm is the restriction of the boundaries. Once a location is near one of the boundaries, it will have a smaller range in searching for my any nearby establishment within its area. Geohash encoding algorithm, uses the Z-order space-filling curve to map between values and geographical points. While the Z-order curve is simple, it possesses several disadvantages. Alternate methods in distributing the geohash codes exist. A method that is used by the researchers is the centralized locating method. That makes the bounding box a dynamic object that will be based on the inputted coordinates of the user. Another method is implemented by the researchers is the kd-tree data structure. To specifically locate the spatial points around the inputted coordinate. The results show that the kd-tree data structure is applicable within the spatial distribution. To further enhance the algorithm, the researchers though of a way to make the Geohash encoding algorithm by adding a third input, altitude. This will make the previous two-dimensional map into a three-dimensional map. Making the algorithm possess the ability to differentiate a location in the same establishment but with different floors."

We, the researchers, take the challenge to further dig in and enhanced the last year’s study. As we study. We come up to three different problems. The first problem we discover was obtaining the value of n which increases threat and vulnerabilities. To assure that the value of n is not factorable, we create a secured method to counter measure mathematical attack. First, we remove the classification of generating two random prime numbers based on the length of the message. Second. Increasing the value of p and q into 9 to 13 digits so it wouldn’t be easy for the attacker to guess the value of p and q. The second problem lies when having low e (public key exponent) in which weaken the security of the algorithm. To prevent a small value of e, we have created a method that provides a better threshold in generating the value of e. In the enhanced algorithm, it generates an 8-digit random number of e relatively prime to (n). The third problem lies again in security issue. Lack of security and authenticating of user’s identification. Distribution of both Public key & Private key to the right client (user) identification) must be validated . To create a secured approach on dealing with client information and proper authentication, we add extra of user’s authentication and verification RSA has become of the most important public key encryption schemes in today’s computing world.

The research draws upon three main problems including parallelism on the output with the same passwords. Computational speed was a factor which made the algorithm prone to brute-force attacks. Look up tables also offer pre-computed hashes along with its corresponding plaintext value making the outputs easily derived in connection to said problems, the study involves discovering on how to produce different outputs regardless of the same passwords.

Vertex Cover is the process of finding sets of vertices in a given graph where in the all edges would be covered by the said of vertices. The researchers discovered that the Alom’s Algorithm has a big room for improvement. The researchers found 3 problems in the algorithm and corresponding 3 objectives to solve those problems. The first goal is to find every possible combination of the minimum vertex cover. Minimum vertex cover is a set of vertex cover where in it contains the least number of vertices needed to cover the whole graph. Another objective is find the vertex cover of size = k, the Alom’s algorithm can only find the minimum vertex cover present in the graph, we enhanced it by letting the user input the size of the vertex cover (size k) to be searched in the graph. The last objective is find the optimal minimum vertex cover in all graphs, in some cases the algorithm fails to give the optimal result because of the process it has. We enhanced it by first checking the set of minimum vertex cover if it is optimal before returning it as output. The researchers concluded that even though the Alom’s algorithm is the best algorithm concerning vertex cover it can be improved to perform better and get the best possible results."

Lastly, the existing algorithm ignores one-sentenced paragraph regardless of the score, so the proponents took into consideration all one-sentenced paragraph in summarization since it is frequently used in emphasis. Based on the text results by doing these modifications the text summarization now became more precise in terms of summary result since it follows standard English students and researchers can now use this algorithm. The enhanced algorithm can be further improved by allowing text with typographical errors, wrong grammar, and misused of punctuation to be evaluated since it can only correctly summarize text that undergone proofreading."

",March,2019,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"This study is about the enhancement of Honey Encryption Algorithm. Honey Encryption is a new encryption algorithm that includes the element of deception, which offers an additional layer of protection, plausible, but real-looking data is served up in response to incorrect guesses of passwords or encryption keys. If a hacker does guesses correctly, he probably won’t realize it, because the real data will be floating in a sea of spoof data that appears every bit as a real. However, the algorithm uses symmetric encryption which when decrypted the integrity of data is compromised and also the processing tie is higher. The algorithm’s message and key are stored in one seed which leads to leakage of sensitive private data. Also, the algorithm cannot encrypt if the message is too high. Applying Caesar Cipher and binary number system conversion for both encryption and decryption. Mersenne Twister random number generator and shuffling for generating plausible texts. Also, simple string algorithm is used for compressing the message in the message space.

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Cryptosystems have been an important aspect of the cyber security industry in protecting users against the current rise of cyber criminals and attacks. Public asymmetric cryptosystem, for example, ensures that two keys, a public and a private key, can both protect sensitive and private information against unwanted attackers and hackers. Information sensitive to users often originate from sources such as instant messaging applications that involves rapid exchange of data between two users at the same time. There are lots of encryption algorithm used to counter these attacks and one of this is an INTRU-based Cryptosystem called. ITRU Encryption Algorithm . The proponents of this study had analyzed the current existing ITRU Encryption Algorithm, comparing it against other encryption and stating the problems that the existing algorithm had, and enhanced the algorithm by resolving the analyzed problems so that it could be implemented on a mobile instant messaging client application. It was observed that the existing algorithm was unable to accept and recognize Unicode characters due to the existing algorithm limiting itself to the ASCII encoding scheme of characters. The algorithm also did not trap errors produced when creating the public key using the Extended Euclidean Method. Finally, the algorithm creates an encrypted message with a pattern-like sequence similar to the patterns of the plaintext message due to its one-to-one correspondence of encryption. After further analysis and study of the existing algorithm, the proponents added changes and enhancements that had resolved the problems found before. First, the ASCII encoding scheme was changed into a Byte encoding scheme to expand the scope of encoding scheme that the algorithms uses beyond the ASCII characters. Next, the parameter generation of p was changed from being a constant 1000 to a prime number between m and 630 to prevent the errors produced when generating the keys. Finally, the block cipher algorithm of XOR operations between blocks of messages was implemented to the algorithm itself to randomize the generated ciphertext. The results of the study had shown that the enhanced algorithm was able to accept Unicode characters, particularly Emoji characters, as inputs of data. The enhanced algorithm also produced a zero percent key error rate multiple rounds of testing. Lastly, the enhanced algorithm produced a completely randomized ciphertext with no noticeable one-to-one correspondence with the plaintext message. The enhanced algorithm had been applied to an instant messaging application created by the proponents and had shown similar results from the simulation of the proposed algorithm. In conclusion, the proponents had successfully enhanced the existing ITRU encryption algorithm and had resolved all analyzed problems of the existing algorithm. The proposed algorithm had also been successfully implemented to an instant messaging application. The proponents recommend future studies to consider other platforms for messaging applications such as IOS and Windows in implementing the ITRU encryption algorithm."

The algorithm results into a cave-like map that can be used in different ways such as games. The main objective of this study is to enhance Cellular Automata Algorithm to improve its performance and capabilities in generating a cave. The study can be useful to different fields but the focus is to those game developers or designers who are interested in making games that has maps such as open world, roguelike or adventure games. Cellular automata is already the best algorithm for cave map generation but it has some drawbacks such as tendency to generate disconnected maps, huge-open spaces and it lacks the ability to create a pathway outside the cave. We have improved the Cellular Automata by adding tweaks and additional rules to the algorithm to produce a better map generator. We connected the isolated regions, lessen the big area spaces and added a pathway outside the cave. Lastly, the researchers applied it into a desktop game application that will reflect the use of the enhanced cellular automata algorithm.

It is done to obtain the clear images from which text can be retrieved easily. Thresholding is used for the segmentation of the document images. The study focuses on the most commonly used local binarization method. Sauvola-Shafait’s thresholding algorithm. It performs comparatively well on document images; however, faults persist: the three channels of colored document images are binarized separately and displayed alongside each other, it is not robust to low contrast, and the window size parameter significantly affects document images with various text sizes. In order to narrow down its limitations, an RGB-to-grayscale converting algorithm and an adaptive noise-removal 2-D median filter are appended, and the range of window size is determined by the size of the input image. So as to evaluate the performance of the enhanced algorithm. Moghaddam’s objective evaluation of binarization methods for document images is used wherein the output is compared to a ground truth image.

Cluster analysis or commonly known as clustering is the grouping of similar data objects in a set. As technology evolves, number of algorithm used in clustering increased. One of these clustering algorithm is the k-medoids algorithm. K-medoids is an algorithm under the same umbrella of k-means. Presently, the latest version of k-medoid was formulated in a book , entitled “Foundation of Intelligent Systems” by M. Kryszkiewics, A. Appice, D. Slezak, H. Rybinski, A Skowron and Z.W. Ras in June 2017. In this enhanced k-medoid clustering, the algorithm produces clustering results with higher intra-cluster similarity and lower inter-cluster similarity. However, there are still three problems are identified on this algorithm. First is that the algorithm has no method of deciding where to best assign a data point the same distance to multiple clusters. Second, the existing algorithm is not guaranteed to provide an optimal medoid for each cluster due to this algorithm using greedy search. Lastly, the algorithm naturally clusters, without identifying potential outlets. Due to this, the proponents decided to further this algorithm and apply it on an application will be very beneficial for blood donation advertisers . The researchers aim to integrate formulas and algorithms to the existing k-medoid in order to solve the problems stated. For the first problem, the formula for population variance was used. For the second problem, instead of finding new medoids by computing the total cost for each clustering, the solution formulated by the researchers was to ensure that in each cluster, the data point that has the minimum average distance will be considered as the medoiid. Lastly, distance-based method was used in order to determine whether a data point is an outlier. "

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Auction is a common name for several types of sales where the price is neither set nor arrived at by negotiation, but is discovered through the process of competitive and open bidding. An auction has well-defined rules that enforce an agreement between the auctioneer and the winning bidder. One of the best-known auction algorithm is the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Algorithm, named after William Vickrey, Edward H. Clarke, and Theodore Groves for their papers that successively generalized the idea. It is an auction algorithm that can be used for combinatorial auctions in which multiple items/goods are sold simultaneously. It has been exposed for many years that the idea and the algorithm itself can never be changed. Despite that, enhancements would still be much considered. First are the odds that the auctioneer will get a low revenue. It was eliminated by adding a process in which succeeding bids for the same bidder will be compared. Second is the occurrence of false-name bids which revokes the algorithms incentive compatibility. Last is the algorithms susceptibility to bidders collusion which affects its efficiency and undermines the auction severely. In order to preserve the algorithm’s incentive compatibility and its efficiency, it has been made false-named-proof, and collusion-resistant. With that said, a more reliable auction algorithm used in an online combinatorial auction was achieved by modifying the existing Vickrey-Clarke-Groves Algorithm."

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"This study entitled “An Enhancement of Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency Algorithm Applied in Document Retrieval System” is an exploration of any improvements available for the algorithm. The main objective of this study is to enhance certain processes of the algorithm to improve its performance in retrieving relevant documents. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency has been of the most highly used document retrieved method for many years. The researchers found that there could be a big potential for improvement. Recent advances in computer and technology resulted into over increasing set of documents. The term weighting strategy plays an essential role in document retrieval. Term weighting is proposed to give equal opportunities to retrieve both lengthy documents and shorter ones. The first goal is to include retrieving documents when the query contains pure stop words. Stop words are very common words in a document that could have a higher-TF-IDF score since they occur more frequent although they do not mean that much. The researchers wanted to retrieve documents if the query contains pure stop words for it might mean so much in the documents. Another objective is to treat multiple terms as one token for retrieval. The last one is retrieving of documents that includes the root word of the query. Fortunately, the researchers made the solution for these objectives become possible by their proposed new and additional methods to bring enhancement to the algorithm. The proponents suggest using the enhanced algorithm either in an offline document search engine or online because of its versatility. It is also recommended to use by an administrator-user basis because it has log-in and log-out feature."

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Passface Algorithm is a Recognition-based Graphical Password algorithm that was developed by Brostoff that uses human face as password. Passface is a unique strong authentication technology that works with the existing security systems access. It is based on the mind’s capacity to recognize faces, an ability that has evolved in all of us over million of years. It is easy to implement and easy to use, making it attractive to end users. People might not be able to associate a name with face, but the brain can recognize a face for months, or even years after the first encounter. Upon studying the Passface algorithm, the researchers found three (3) problems. First, the passface are selected by mouse which makes it very easy for the shoulder surfer attacker to observe the password. Second, the user’s preferences make it easy for the Guessing attacker to identify the user’s passface. Third, the Passface algorithm is non-resistance to brute force attacks due to limited password space. To solve those problems, the researchers proposed solutions. First, to prevent shoulder surfing attacks by implementing recognition-based graphical password technique based on the false image. Second, to avoid attackers from guessing passfaces by blurring (low-spatial frequency) the passface during the login process. Lastly, to prevent brute force attacks by dividing passface into 4 image portions. In order to prove those solutions, the researchers conducted surveys and present supporting documents. The enhanced Passface algorithm was proven to solve the three problem that was encountered. In the enhanced algorithm, the password space is larger because of the application of the falsification, the passface is being selected keyboard which made it harder for the shoulder-surfer attack, and the passfaces are already blurred to do so that the attackers will have a hard time guessing the passface."

",March,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Gibberish Classification algorithm aims to detect whether the text is valid, or randomly typed in a keyboard. It returns a percentage where a low one means valid text, and a high one means gibberish text. If the result is lower than 50%, it’s likely that the text is valid. If a result is higher than 50%, it’s likely that the text is gibberish. The algorithm is optimized for the English Language and for longer text. While studying the existing gibberish classification algorithm, the researchers encountered these following problems: First, the algorithm still considers valid English words as gibberish when its suppose to classify it as not gibberish. Second, the algorithm classifies the inputted text that contains not often used symbols in the English document as valid words when its suppose to classify it as gibberish. And lastly, the algorithm has a 60% accuracy rate, in classifying text whether the inputted words are gibberish or not. To improve the existing algorithm, the researcher’s solution to the encountered problems are as follows; First, adding the Markow Chain model in the computation of the algorithm when it comes to classifying gibberish content of a word. Next is the Special character filtering, this additional computation for punctuation marks made the algorithm character filtering, this additional computation for punctuation marks made the algorithm 90% or higher correct when it comes to giving the result in computing gibberish words with symbols, numbers or both in its composition. Enhancing the Gibberish Classification Algorithm will be a great help to people, especially to English Proficiency teachers, and people who wants to detect if there are gibberish content in their texts."

Providing access to an authenticated user is definitely not as easy as it looks. All the users may want to have a more secured authentication system, but no one seems to be compromised with the usability of the system. While making the authentication scheme more complex is considered as one way, it is also very important to have the complexity in the attacker side and not in the user side itself: Cued Click Point Algorithm is a click-based graphical password scheme, a cued-recall graphical password technique in which users click on one point per image for a sequence of images. The next image is based on the previous click-point. The passwords which are easy to memorize are chosen by the authentic users and it becomes easy for attackers to guess it. In this study, we focus on the evaluation and enhancement of the graphical password authentication using Cued Click Point, including usability and security. In this authentication system, our usability goal is to support the users in selecting more secured passwords, thus increases the security by expanding the effective password space. To address the problems encountered, we provide the combination of the double click method and circular tolerance which helps to produce a more sophisticated authentication scheme."

",March ,2019,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,Undergraduate,"Data compression is the process of encoding, modifying, or converting the bits structure of data in such a way it consumes less disk space. One of the newest data compression algorithms is the J-Bit Encoding Algorithm. It was invented by Agus Dwia Suarjaya in 2013. This algorithm uses manipulation of bits inside the file. The algorithm investigates every bit of the file and analyzes it for compression. Using this algorithm, we found out that the algorithm produces a much better larger file after compression when it is compressing files that are mixes of images and text or audio and video. Also, the algorithm does not read the contents of the compressed file making it unable to be decompressed when the local copies of the data I and II is absent which are produced by the algorithm. And lastly, the algorithm does not attain one of the most important roles which is not to lose any bits of data because J-bit encoding algorithm is a lossless compression algorithm. These problems are solved by first, adding 2 different algorithms before and after the existing algorithm namely, the Move-to-Front Transform and the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm, respectively. Second, using a zip file to consolidate all the needed files that will be used in decompression. Lastly, using of the Apache Commons IO API that reconstructed the file based only on the inputted data stream and on the file extension that it extracted during the compression process. We recommend this enhanced algorithm to be further enhance by optimizing the processes involved, using of another transform algorithm for transforming wide range of symbols, and compressing multiple files."

In the given duration of the entity in the industry, the company has manifested a satisfactory performance as to revenue contributing to its continuous increase of net worth over the years. The entity's main problem is idle cash which constitute more than half of the assets which do not earn interest. The idle cash in banks which is non-interest bearing are unrestricted and immediately available for use in their current operation. Although the entity generates high revenue, it is mostly consummated by the high cost of merchandise incurred considering the given nature of business. Thus, the entity suffers from a poor profitability in the previous years. Moreover, the collection of receivables is not effective. To solve all these current problems of the entity, the researchers recommend to create a service line that offers installation and maintenance of air conditioners for non-buyer to widen the potential market. Thus, the services offered will not be limited to its contracted high-end condominiums and buyers but also the non-buyers. To determine whether the chosen course of action to the specific problem which is found by the researchers is practicable, the proponents conducted a feasibility study. The study covered households within 3km radius of Mandaluyong City as the target market and conducted survey among 100 respondents to get their demand and preferences in services offered for air conditioners.

The idle cash in bank which is a non-interest bearing is available for use in their current operations. Although the entity generates enough revenue, they are not maximizing the use of their cash to generate higher profit. Thus, Uni-Ship, Incorporated suffers low working capital turnover for the past five years. Methods of analysis include trend, horizontal and vertical analyses as well as the calculation of financial ratios specifically Current Ratio, Cash Ratio and Working Capital Turnover ratio to come up with the best understanding to the problem. All calculations can be found in the appendices. Almost all the ratios meet the cut offs and standard or the benchmark ratio which is the basis of interpretation of its results. After in-depth study of facts and information gathered on Uni-Ship, Incorporated and further examination of their business, the analysts recommend for the entity to extend their service line that offers trucking that would engage more domestically to widen potential market. Hence, the services offered will not be limited to their usual clients but also to other possible and interested clients. The analysts aim to efficiently manage the entity's excess funds by proposing the extension of their service line to maximize the use of their cash in improving their working capital turnover.

Universal Robina Corporation's Blend 45 is among the Philippines' pioneers in the coffee industry. It has been operating for over 50 years since John Gokongwei, Jr. established the Universal Robina Corporation in 1954. URC's mission is to remain the as the largest branded food product companies in the Philippines with a growing presence in other ASEAN Markets. And its vision is to be the best Philippine food and beverage company, with a powerful presence throughout the ASEAN region, carrying a wide portfolio of delightful brands of exeptional quality and value, equipped with efficient systems and motivated people. They are committed in making lives a truly fun experience.There's still a need for a research for Blend 45 Coffee Mix because even though it has existed in the market for about 45 years, its market share is still low compared to other brands. Based on the research conducted, out of a hundred respondents, 92% of them were familiar with Blend 45, but most of them haven't tried it yet. The Long term Objectives of Blend 45 are: to improve and strenghten its market relationship in the coffee industry, to achieve a higher position among their competitors and to increase customer satisfaction and to increase market share by 9%. These objectives will be supported by the new set of marketing mix. First is the product. For the product development, Blend 45 plans to first improve the current offerings of the company by adding more coffee content since most of the respondents who participated in this study said that the coffee mix lacks coffee content. The second product improvement is to add more cream due to high demand of most of respondents to increase the cream in the coffee mix. The last one for the product improvement is to lessen the sugar level since it's too sweet for most people. Another product strategy is to blend new flavors of the coffee mix. Blend 45 Coffee Mix's flavors are all Pinoy inspired that's why we decided to blend new flavors of this coffee using the products or goods of our country too. Blend 45 will introduce two new flavors in the market namely the Blend 45 Kapeng Tsoko and Blend 45 Kapeng Strawberry. Blend 45 Kapeng Tsoko is a choco-infused coffee blended with just the right amount of coffee granules and powdered tables to have the chocolaty taste that almost everyone enjoy. Another flavor is the Blend 45 Kapeng Strawberry, a flavor inspired by the strawberry-flavored frappes served by coffee shops. Blend 45 plans to produce this flavor for everybody to enjoy and have the fruity taste of strawberry in their coffee since those frappes served in coffee shops are a bit pricy. The last strategy under product development is to create new varieties of the product. Today, Blend 45 has only 2 varieties. Their coffee stick for Kape Puro and the 3-in-1 sachets for the flavored coffee mix. Blend 45 plans to introduce 3 new varieties of the product namely the ready to drink bottled coffee, the styro cup coffee and the twin packs sachet which has a discounted price where you can buy 2 sachets of coffee mix in a price lower than if you will buy two regular sachets. For the new price strategy of Blend 45, the coffee mix plans to maintain the price since it's already the right price for the product because if the price will be higher than the usual, Blend might lose customers and may not attract new ones. Discounted prices are for the twin packs sachets only. For the new place strategy, Blend plans to target most of the stores in the country s the brand expands its distribution nationwide to reach more customers. Last is the promotion strategy where Blend needs to increase the number of advertisements to raise awareness of the brand. Though Blend 45 has existed for 45 years in the market, it still has the lowest share among coffee brands. Blend also plans to increase their promotional activity. An example of this is the"" Kapeng Pinoy, Lakbay Pinoy"" promo where customers need to buy products of Blend 45 for them to have a chance to win a trip around the country's beautiful places not only to promote the product but also the country is the coffee mix is a Pinoy-inspired one."

Caudal,October,2017,College of Science,Bachelor of Science in Psychology,Undergraduate,"Academic stress is considered to be a part of students life and can impact the students coping strategies in accordance with the demands of academic life. This is so because academic work is always accomplished with stressful activities. For some students, academic stress is manageable (and even helpful, providing needed motivation and energy) – but for others, this can become so great that it interferes with their ability to focus and concentrate. In line with this, as students feel that academic stress is interfering with their ability to function in the right way, they resort to some activities that somehow help them cope with the constant feeling of academic stress. One coping mechanism that seems to be patronized by one of the most informed generation nowadays is the internet memes. The sample size was derived using purposive sampling and the results were gathered using a set of survey questions. Through a descriptive statistical method, it has been that senior high school students view internet memes for a temporary relief. Internet memes create distance between a person viewing it and the academic demands. Aside from its seemingly mindless and pure entertainment value, internet memes can be an effective tool for an access to various informations locally and internationally. Greater number of respondents expressed their agreement with the significance of internet memes to the online community. It provides different accessible informations that aim to provide essential quality knowledge. Communication of nideas and experiences has been possible through transmitting memes. Therefore, people behind these viral images with catchphrases must be responsible enough in creating such and future researchers should also try to use other respondents aside from senior high school students to test the reliability of meme viewing as a coping mechanism."

COPD is not fully reversible and it greatly affects patient's quality of life through exacerbation of symptoms. Improving HRQoL, as an medical outcome, is the major management to increase survival rate of COPD patients. The study aims to assess the quality of life of COPD patients and factors affecting it. There were 31 patients diagnosed c COPD participated in the study from health centers of District V in Manila City and were selected through a purposing sampling. To determine their QOL, participants were assessed using SGRO with three dimensions including symptoms, activities and impact. Scores gathered are calculated by summin up all the positive responses in the SGRQ and indicated the result as a pecentage and correlations were analyzed in reference to clinical profile. The mean age of COPD patients fro selected District V Health Centers was 63 y/o and it was not correlated with HRQoL. It was found that COPD has high impact of the condition in terms of symptoms, activity and impact domain. The burden of COPD among patients in the District V health centers on HRQoL was found to be higher than 95% of the population. Keywords: COPD, QOL, Manila, health-related quality of life"

Ybonne F., Uy, Madeleine Iya Gabriella M. ",March,2019,College of Physical Therapy,Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy ,Health Sciences,"The emergence of Virtual Reality (VR) in the rehabilitation was found to be a delightful complement to the usual exercises as it is useful in a fun, challenging way of exercising that can address common balance impairments. With its primary goal, that is, to transfer virtually learned skills into real performance abilities, this new trend gives patients the opportunity to reproduce activities of daily living in realistic, simulated environments with the assistance of physical therapists. While PTs provide patients with an interaction where the patients actively participate, it was also instituted that this therapeutic modality may somehow create uncertainties to some of the therapists during treatment session. This conflicting perspectives of various studies regarding VR in abroad and the scarceness of locally available studies, the researchers pointed to know mainly the perception of using virtual rehabilitation by physical therapists working as clinician in a hospital-based rehabilitation centers in Manila. Their degree of perception in virtual reality was measured by five factors (attitude, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, compatibility, and social norms) derived from the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior. Alongside with this, the demographic and professional characteristic of PTs was also assessed in this paper. Using descriptive quantitative study design, this investigation revealed that PTs working as clinicians in hospital-based centers in Manila (n=77) were mostly familiar with VR (71.43%). As for record, more PTs (25.45%) had used this device in the past as compared to current time which only few (3.64%) are choosing this modality in their treatment session. It is also shown in this study, based from the five factors of Decomposed Theory, majority of the PT's perception cling to factor Attitude (x=7.0061). They strongly agreed that using VR is a good idea as it is also fun to use to their patients in their physical rehabilitation. Along with this, they also agreed to the factor Perceived Usefulness (x=6.9515) as they believed that VR will improve patient's condition by giving good result in their functional outcome, offer variety to treatment, and provide additional benefit beyond to any conventional treatment approach.

MMA is a combination of two or more martial arts or fighting disciplines, which impose extreme physical demand on the body. And there are a plethora of injuries that MMA fighters are vulnerable to in relation with the style of martial art practiced. Unfortunately, there are limited studies and literature about MMA. This study aimed to identify the body part and region affected, severity of head injury-related symptoms, and the probate factors that may affect the frequency and rate of injury occurrence. Such includes, the demographics, training background, and the level of professionalism of MMA fighters. All data are taken within a 30 day-span. The study used period prevalence research design, through the use of literature-based, pilot tested, and professionally validated survey questionnaire to all MMA fighters in training gyms and schools around Quezon City. The study the revealed that most of MMA fighters are 35 years old and younger, with more male fighters than female. Also, that 29% of injuries incurred within the past 30 days are attributed to MMA with most of them acquired during the training. The elbow, ankle and the foot were found to be the most injured body part. Six incurred head injury and the severity of their symptoms are rated as follows: with an average rating of 3.5 vomiting and dizziness acquired the highest rating. There were 10% of the respondents who undergone physical therapy after getting injured with 37% diagnosed through medical examination. A correlation also revealed that longer practice time may result to a higher incidence of injury. To conclude, there is a low prevalence of injuries among MMA fighters of gyms around Quezon City assessed within a 30-day span.

A variety of factors have been shown to influence first-take success on the licensure exam. Among these factors, the most commonly investigated is the undergraduate grade point average (GPA). However, contradicting its commonality is the paucity in literature particularly in the local setting to what extent can GPA and other academic factors affect licensure performance. The current study explored the predictive power and correlation of OGWA and length of residency within the BSPT program to first-take performance on the August and February PTLE from 2014 to 2018 of 292 students from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM). Using a correlational retrospective design and Spearman’s rank correlation, data analysis revealed that OGWA and length of residence were significantly associated with performance on the PTLE. Both were having a linear but inverse relationship to PTLE performance; whereas OGWA or length of residency increases, the PTLE rating decreases. Performance on the PTLE may perhaps be multifactorial, OGWA and length of residency only consume a fraction of the diverse set of factors that can ultimately affect examination performance. Investigating predictors to success on the PTLE serves useful for BSPT programs in providing targeted intervention to at-risk students, improving quality PT education, student outcomes and teaching strategies of PT educators.Keywords: Physical therapy Licensure Examination, Correlation, Academic performance, OGWA, Recidency"

",March,2019,College of Physical Therapy,Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy ,Health Sciences,"Background: Falls are the most severe and most common home accident among elderly individuals following various potential comorbidity. Also, the relationship between risk for falls and physical activity based on previous studies presents conflicting results. While some claimed that there was no association between physical activity level and falls (J. Klenk et al., 2015), one argued the inverse association between the two (L. Salehi, E. Jamshidi, and A. Montazeri, 2014; and K.C. Heasch, J.E. Byles, and W.J. Brown, 2007). In the Philippine context, no published article was found concerning the relationship of the levels of physical activity to risk of falls among elderly individuals. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine the relationship of risk for falls to the demographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, BMI, marital status, occupation, and MMSE-P score), and the levels of physical activity of the elderly individuals in the barangays of Intramuros, Manila. Methodology: A total of 64 elderly individuals were able to complete the implementation process. Participants were assessed for risk for falls using the Timed-Up-and-Go Test, physical activity using the Filipino-translated International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Long Form, and participant’s general information form to determine the demographic profiles of the elderly individuals. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was calculated to determine the relationship between the variables, Results: Results revealed no significant correlations of fall risk with gender (rs=0.034, p=0.787), age (rs=0.006, p=0.960), BMI (rs=0.057, p=0.655), marital status (rs=0.027, p=0.835) (rs= -0.700). and MMSE-P scores (rs= -0.021, p=0.871); and no correlation between the levels of physical activities and the risk of falls (rs= -0.035, p= 0.785) among the elderly individuals residing in Intramuros, Manila. A possible threat to internal validity is the decreased sample size in which only -20% (N-64) were gathered out of 357 was the computed sample.

",March,2017,College of Physical Therapy,Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy ,Health Sciences,"Background and Purpose: Postural neck pain, secondary to soft tissue adhesions and presence of myofascial trigger points in the bilateral upper trapezius, is one of the prevalent complaints among office employees. The emergence of manual therapy techniques, specifically the self-myofascial release using a grid foam roller, with the aim of treating myofascial restrictions for purposes of alleviating pain , removing adhesions, and increasing range of motion, are now being used by a number of physical therapists as treatment of choice. However, there are limited, if not, no study exists to support the use of such technique. This study sought to identify the immediate effects of grid foam roller as compared with the traditional myofascial release in decreasing postural neck pain among office employees. Methods: A quasi experimental design was used to determine the immediate effects of grid foam roller versus traditional myofascial release in decreasing postural neck pain. Thirty participants were selected by purposive sampling and were grouped into experimental ( grid foam roller) and control (traditional myofascial release).The outcome measures for this study were pain and range of motion, which were measured using pain numerical rating scale and a regular plastic goniometer for cervical range of motion in extension, bilateral lateral flexion, and bilateral rotation respectively. Data was recorded at pre and posttest, and was analyzed using paired t-test , Cohen’s d, & independent t-test on SPSS version 21. Results and Conclusions: Results revealed that both groups have shown a significant decrease in the pain numerical rating scale both before and after treatment. There were also significant improvements on all cervical range of motion both before and after treatment using the grid foam roller. However, only the cervical range of motion of extension and lateral flexion in both before and after the treatment. Overall, no significant differences were evident between the experimental and control group in terms of pain numerical rating scale and all cervical range of motions.

534,book_pic/image.jpg,Extent of Application of EBP Process by PT clinicians in PLM-affiliated Institutions,"Capati, John Vincent C., Fernando, Vera Gabrielle F., Mallari, Claire Koleen F., Pestaño, Celestine Marie A.",March,2019,College of Physical Therapy,Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy ,Health Sciences,"Background: Evidence-based practice for the Physical therapists is ""the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients."" It is necessary for the professionals to know, understand, and develop the skills in implementing the EBP process (Sacket et. al, 2000), because evidence has shown that its application is cost — effective, promotes better quality of life (Care, 2016) and yields better outcomes with a decreasing healthcare cost (Youngblut & Brooten, 2001). However, despite of its effectiveness, there are many factors that hinder the success of implementation of EBP. These include ""varying education and clinical experiences of clinical staff, and a lack of understanding about its importance to optimal high-quality patient care""(Tacia et. al 2015). In the local setting, it was stated that the implementation of EBP is a challenging process due to the inconsistency of the barriers affecting its usage (Dizon, Grimmer-Somers, & Kumar, 2014). Moreover, Gorgon, Basco, & Manuel (2013) have found out that there is no standardized way on how it should be taught and used. This current situation would definitely make an impact in the implementation of EBP in the clinical setting. However, presently, there are no data that shows on the details of its implemented in the clinical setting, especially in PLM-affiliated institutions. With this in mind, we would like to find out the current extent of usage of EBP process being implemented in the clinical setting. Purpose: This study identified the extent of the Evidence Based Practice process that are being implemented by PT clinicians in PLM-affiliated institutions It also determined the educational background of the physical therapists related to Evidence Based Practice. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was used in this study by answering a validated questionnaire. Results: This study revealed the EBP process implementation scores of PT clinicians currently working in PLM-affiliated institutions. The respondents (n=93) yielded high extent for the category of asking clinical questions, low extent for searching for evidence literature, and low extent for critical appraisal. Meanwhile, low extent were achieved for the categories of use or integration of research and evaluation of outcomes, respectively. The educational background of the PT clinicians working in PLM-affiliated institutions have BSPT as their highest educational attainment whereas 4(4.3%) are currently undertaking and 2(2.2%) have already completed their MSPT degree, while 1 (1.1%) is still completing and 3 (3.2%) have already graduated in their DPT program. EBP-related subjects that the respondents have encountered in their undergraduate studies is the most commonly taken subject with 73 (78.49%), whereas only 10 (10.75%) took up biostatistics. However, there are 14 (15.05%) respondents who did not encounter any EBP-related subject in their undergraduate. In the MSPT category, only 1 (1.08%) took EBP that was incorporated in the subject while 4 (4.30%) respondents had EBP as an independent subject. Likewise, in the DPT category, there were 2 (2.15%) each who answered that EBP was incorporated and was an independent subject in their program. 52 (51.49%) of the respondents of the respondents did not have any specific training, 13 (12.87%) answered that they cannot recall the training they have had. Meanwhile, 4 (3.96%) trained under evidence-based practice and integration- related programs and 4 (3.96%) took up clinical decision-making, education and teaching training. Likewise, 8 (7.92%) received training on neuromuscular-related techniques, 7 (6.93%) on musculoskeletal-related techniques and 7 (6.93%) received trainings on burn management, dry needling, mentoring. taping and kinesiotaping. Conclusion: The extent of EBP process implementation of PLM-affiliated institutions performed most of the time with Asking Clinical Questions has the highest extent while Evaluation of Outcomes has the lowest average score amongst the five processes. Most of the highest educational attainment in educational background of PT clinicians is Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy. Research is the most incorporated subject under the EBP-related subject in undergraduate while most of the respondents did not encounter EBP-related subjects in their undergraduate. Most of the PT clinicians did not have specific training. Keywords: Evidence Based Practice, Physical therapy clinicians, PLM-affiliated institutions, EBP Process, implementation "

And to secure its main purpose, this device should be appropriately fit to distinct patient to promote improvement not only in their health but also in their quality of life. Such appropriateness in measures can prevent common problems brought about by misfit, that is, pressure sores, progression of deformities, and development of other secondary conditions. While these kind of findings are being studied, still some researches arises with regard to the predominant usage of misfit wheelchairs due to lack of prescription and proper evaluation prior to its usage. This outcome lead the researcher to study the association of the five dimension of wheelchair fit in terms of patients' posture upright comfortability, from the side, and from front/back. Owing to limited sources of readily available research locally today with regards to the status of wheelchair users in terms its appropriateness, the researches would also want to determine and illustrate whether the wheelchair is properly fitted to selected patients among particular foundations in Manila and Quezon City. This paper is a descriptive correlational study. A total of 46 selected wheelchair users from six foundations within Manila and Quezon City were assessed and revealed that patients in selected foundation who uses wheelchair unfit to them were mostly at the age range of 61-80 years old (41.3%), male (52.2%) and have a common condition which is poliomyelitis (30.4%). Using the basic wheelchair fitting questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization. Participants' wheelchairs were checked based on the following dimensions: (1) seat width (2) seat depth (3) footrest height (4) backrest height; and, (5) seat height. With descriptive data analysis, only 8/0% had conformed to proper wheelchair fitting to its user, revealing seat height (78.3%) as the most fitted to wheelchair users followed by footrest height, seat depth, backrest height, and seat width. As with the most unfit wheelchair dimension, seat width (60.9%) was found to be the highest followed by backrest height, seat depth, footrest height and the least unfit was the seat height. Association of wheelchair fit and postural observation was determined using 95% confidence interval set at p value of 0.05 and discovered that no association was noted between dimension of wheelchair fit and postural observations in upright comfortability (p=0.2232), from side (p=0.2232) and from front/back (p=0.2232). Although the researchers complied with the minimum sample requirement and the number of participants cannot be generalized to the whole population of differently-abled person and the appropriateness of their wheelchair measurement, still this research stir us up that it is not uncommon to our differently-abled patients to experience inconvenience in using wheelchair since most of them are consuming it inappropriately in terms of its measured fitness. With the above outcome in investigation, researchers, readers and other involved persons are hearten to be more heedful in assuring fitness in every patient.

Many of the hiking sites in the Philippines require having a local tour guide not just to give job opportunities to their locals. but to ensure safety by having those people who are accustomed to the trails of the mountain to lead the activity. One of the famous hiking places in the Philippines is Mt. Pamitinan, located in Rodriguez. Rizal. Mount Pamitinan, a 426 MASL-high mountain is famous for its rocky spots ideal for breathtaking photos with a view of the Wawa Dam that attracts the tourists, foreign and local alike. It is considered a minor climb with the forested and rocky terrain. Those who have tried mountain hiking reported a feeling of pain and fatigue afterward. The researchers turned their focus on the mountaineering tour guides who are accustomed to every terrain of the mountain they work with. The respondents of this study were 101 mountaineering tour guides of Mt. Pamitinan who passed the inclusion criteria. The research is about the association.of demographic profiles as to sex, age, BMI and professional profile as to working hours per week and length of experience to the occurrence of MSDs. A survey-interview was conducted with the respondents. Results showed that majority of the hikers are male (80%) within 30-39 years old with normal body mass index. No association was found between age and BMI to the occurrence of MSDs. On the other hand, an association was found in occurring MSDs to females, and with working hours per week and length of experience. The results showed the high incidence of MSDs in the upper back with females. With working hours, the study revealed that those who work for less than 10 hours weekly have a high incidence of complaining MSDs specifically in the shoulders, while hips and thighs were greatly affected for those working as mountaineering tour guides on their first 25-36 months.

Evidences support that the use of all EBP processes promotes improved patient outcomes and contributes to high quality patient care. However, in the PH setting, Gorgon (2013) states in his study, that there is an overall absence of authority, skill, training of clinicians among faculty members that would establish competence in EBP in the academic setting. Subsequently, there are very few literatures on the use of Evidence Based Practice among Physical Therapy staff in the clinical setting in the country. Purpose: This study aims to determine the self-reported frequency of use, degree of attitude and current skill in the use of evidence based practice of clinical staffs in Manila and Quezon City. This study also relates the years of experience, specialization and membership in organization with clinical staffs' attitude, use and skill towards the use of EBP in the clinical setting. Methods: A cross sectional, descriptive study was conducted using a purposive sample of Physical Therapy staff based in Manila and Quezon city. Data was gathered by distribution of Modified Clinical Effectiveness and Evidence Based Practice Questionnaire. Results: The respondents were 53.4% female and 46.6% male. Majority (78%) are aged between 20-31 years old and have been working for more than 3 years (62.7%). Most respondents (29.7%) specialized in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. While the frequency with which respondents reported performing each of the six steps of EBP ranged from ""never"" to ""frequently,"" results revealed (Table 2) that participants most frequently answered to occasionally using each EBP process. Participants viewed EBP positively as manifested by 99.2% believing that evidence based practice is fundamental to professional practice. However, majority of the respondents rated their skills only to be ""fair"" in 8 out of 14 EBP skills (Table 8) and the remaining 6 were rated as ""very good."" Moreover, none of the demographic characteristics showed statistically significant difference in relation to participants' frequency of use, attitudes, and skills towards EBP. Conclusion: This study has shown Quezon and Manila City based Physical Therapy staffs have positive attitudes towards EBP and occasionally use it in their practice. Despite this, they only present to be fairly skilled in their utilization of EBP. Furthermore, their frequency of use, attitudes and skills towards EBP is not affected by their years of experience, specialization, and membership to PPTA.

In the Philippines, there is a limited local data and literature determining the experiences of youth living with a chronic physical condition, the degree of physical impairment, or the severity of their chronic health conditions as to their functional status. The primary aim of the study is to determine the relationship of the Health-related QoL and the Functional Status of persons with MD affiliated with the Muscular Dystrophy Association of the Philippines (MDAP). This study also aims to identify the: demographic profiles of the respondents; the mean score of the QoL of patients with MD using the WHO QoL – BREF as well as the relationship between its domains; and, the mean score of the functional status of patients with MD using the Muscle Dystrophy Functional Rating Scale (MDFRS) as well as the relationship between its domains. The researchers utilized a descriptive-correlational design to analyze the relationship between the QoL and functional status of patients with different kinds of MD to compare the different kinds of MD to compare the different domains of QoL as to functional status using the WHOQOL-BREF and MDFRS, respectively. No correlation between the domains of WHOQOL-BREF to the domains of MDFRS were found. The relationship between the domains of the WHOQOL-BREF (physical, psychological, social and environment) showed moderate to high degree of correlation, wherein the social domain scored the highest. The relationship between the domains of the MDFRS (mobility, basic ADL, arm function, impairment) showed similar results, and arm function domain scored the highest. The findings in this study provides some support for the conceptual premise that majority of the patients with muscular dystrophy acquired good QoL despite limited physical capabilities. The researchers believed that support group and psychosocial factors such as acceptance of one’s image and condition may have implications for the good QoL of patients with MD."

Through the years, progresses were made in the safety and comfort of the process of labor and birth. However, there is still a continuing rise in the number of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. This study centers on the OB-DR nurses’ level of compliance on Essential Intrapartum Newborn Care. Descriptive comparative design was used covering 102 OB-DR nurses from two selected government and two selected private hospitals in Cavite. Purposive sampling was used to select the nurse respondents. The questionnaires that was employed came from the World Health Organization and Department of Health’s Clinical Practice Guidelines for Intrapartum and Immediate Postpartum Care and Early Essential Newborn Care: Clinical Practice Pocket Guide. The profile of the nurse respondents includes age, length of service and formal training on EINC. Informed consent was given to all nurse respondents. Statistical tools that were utilized includes the following: frequency and percentage, mean, standard deviation, independent t-Test, Pearson-r and Pearson Chi-square correlation. The results concluded that there was a significant relationship between the nurse respondents profile variables and their level of compliance on the EINC protocols. Moreover, findings revealed that there was significant difference between the level of compliance of the selected government and private hospitals on EINC when measured against the three levels of EINC interventions namely: Intrapartum, Immediate Newborn Care and Immediate Postpartum. The findings emphasize the need for healthcare institutions to reinforce their information drive on EINC which can lead to its enhanced implementation, thus, leading to an improved quality of care for mothers and babies delivered by health professionals involved in childbirth, newborn care and postpartum care. This may involve engaging and empowering the staff; providing education and training on the best practices and existing gaps and thinking of ways to address the existing needs; discussing potential barriers and introducing EINC protocol through thorough training; and creating a means for continuing monitoring and evaluation."

It was founded in 1974 as sole proprietorship and was engaged with furniture business then in 1986. Greenmar focused on the distribution of furniture mechanism. The furniture industry in the Philippines is challenging because of the current industry players and the support that the local manufacturers are getting from the government through Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The supplier power has strengthened due to the strong government’s goal and the existing suppliers from the international market. The government aims to be the global hub for the furniture product using sustainable materials by 2030 with sturdy and environmentally friendly materials. The competition in the industry is intense as major players of imported furniture continuously increases their market share. There are new entrants of small and medium enterprises (SME) due to government support with the local manufacturers and there is also an increase in world furniture production. These factors contribute to the competition and bargaining powers of buyers strong . To succeed in this industry, it was found out that these critical success factors are imperative for a company to stand out in the competition. These are product quality, product innovation, effective marketing, and promotion, diverse product range and environmental impact. However, Greenmar’s score is 2.50 out of 4.00 and ranked 3rd out of the 4 furniture Suppliers. There are many opportunities and threats in furniture industry that must be considered to successfully create strategies and respond to the external environmental forces. Attractive market growth in local furniture demand, continuous market growth, and modernization of business in the presence of internet are the top three (3) opportunities. On the other hand, the top 3 threats are strong government support in local manufacturer, spending habits, and business replication in the presence of mobile technology. Given these external forces, the Greenmar obtained 2.74 EFE. To evaluate the internal strengths and weakness of Greenmar, it needs to address its ineffective marketing strategy, lack of research and development programs, centralized decision making, not liquid to pay short term debts, and lack of management information system. Greenmar obtained 2.63 for IFE. This study suggests that the company should take market development as main strategy of Greenmar. This further suggests that the company must focus on both workplace and home furniture and fixtures demand, conduct thorough market research on new housing projects/development, and business expansions, invest in online and/virtual showroom platforms, and conduct environmental scanning for possible pop-up showrooms or distribution channels to increase the sales and net income of the company."

The MJC is also engaged in the development and sale of condominium units and residential properties, and lease of an office building through joint venture (JV) arrangements with certain developers. Based on Philippine Statistics Authorities (PSA), service has been a major economic player since 2018 with a growth of 6.3%. The continues decreased of inflation rate from 5.5% to 4.4% in January 2019 signifies an increase of consumption of consumables and services including the alcoholic beverages and tobacco and gaming industry. With this economic movement, families, nowadays, despite of increasing prices, still spend a significant amount of its budget to luxury commodities including alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and recreation. Therefore, we can assume that as these expenses increase, so as the income generated by these families, specially the higher income families, which can be argued as the major target market of the service sector. Apparently, this trend shall help to generate more spendable income year by year that will result to more potential revenue for recreational and service like industries such as horseracing, cockfighting and off-track betting. The consolidated revenue growth of industry players of Php 619 million or 49.42% helps the industry to retain the core business of horseracing.

Year 2016 when the industry dumps a -8.4% because of high gross cost and operating expenses not only in the horseracing but also involvement in other business commitment. As mentioned earlier, the prioritization of the present administration of imposing tax to luxurious commodities and services affect primarily the potential revenue of the company and translate it into tax expense from 10% DST into 20% DST. Another strategic priority of the company is to improve its relationship to penetrate municipalities with anti-gambling ordinances. In conformity with the environment, industry, and company strengths and weaknesses, and the financial challenges confronting the company, the following are the financial and strategic objectives: Increase of 7% over-all revenue every year for the next five years. On market development—OTBs in new areas • To complete at least 13 new OTB’s in provinces or equivalent to 13 terminals for horseracing and 13 terminals for cockfighting as part of OTBV expansion strategy. • To communicate OTB service benefits and other values to new communities. • To provide market research and development on potential new OTB locations and other marketing related activities. • To include horseracing and cockfighting in the OTB expansion package. On market penetration—Strategic OTB positioning. • To establish benchmarks determining OTB performance per area: performing and underperforming OTBs. • To identify and relocate betting terminals, which are not fully maximized. • To fully maximize MJC agreement with PAGCOR to install OTBs inside their hotel casinos. • To identify new OTB locations in penetrated OTB areas. • To develop strategies based on the established benchmarks and findings. • To further establish strategic locations for OTB expansion with existing horseracing OTB but without OCB for cockfighting within and outside Metro Manila (new areas) (40 OTBs). On service development—Higher quality of service • To enforce OTB operators to improve facilities. • To strengthen and replace terminal connectivity to increase operational efficiency, and prepare for other betting technologies. • To strictly implement betting and operational policies and procedures. • To increase and satisfy employee morale to reduce consumer problems and complaints. • To train the frontlines with proper customer service and compliance with the existing company rules and regulations. The Strategy Formulation process utilized different input tools to analyze and evaluate the external (EFE) and internal (IFE) factors to achieve set objectives. The matching tools provide the best strategies for the company.

Based on the data, MJC plays in between Aggressive and Competitive Quadrant. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Matrix results highlight the positioning of MJCI businesses. Cockfighting, racing and rent are considered as the star performers or market leaders of MJC in comparison with the other industry competitors (PRC and MMTC). Although, the Sales of Food and Beverages has the potential to become a market leader due to small difference (net is low) with the present market leader. With regards to Internal-External (IE) Matrix, Cockfighting, Racing and Rent which are all related to the main resources of the company enter the Cells 1, 2 & 3 or the Grow and Build Strategy. The Real Estate is in Hold and Maintain Strategy. However, the Sales of Food and Beverages is within the Harvest and Exit Strategy stating that if costs for rejuvenating the businesses are low, then it should be attempted to revitalized the business hence aggressive cost management is way to play the game in the Food and Beverages Operations. Then the Grand Strategy Matrix (GSM) explains that Real estate is in the middle of all quadrants showing an average performance in terms of competitive position and market growth. Rent lies between Quadrant 1 and 4 signifying potential strong competition with other industry players but slow phasing in terms of rapid growth. MJC Food and Beverage is still consistent with low competitive position and low rapid growth suggesting to give-up the said business and utilized the available resources by renting it with other food and beverage providers. Horse racing and cockfighting on the other hand occupied Quadrant 1 stating a strong competitive position and rapid market growth. These areas are not in the excellent strategic position but has the future of revenue growth. The present market of horseracing is also the potential target market of cockfighting. Hence, these businesses have a synergized effect in OTB Expansion considering the availment of OTB for. Therefore, based on the outcomes of the strategies, Pareto Principle shall apply by considering the betting business, which comprised almost 75% of the total revenue, to be the main concern of this paper. Although, this paper shall also make strategies for other revenue-centred divisions. The over-all results of different matrices recommend three major strategies (1) market penetration, (2) market development and (3) service development. With the implementation of the strategies, the company is expected to earn an over-all revenue of Php6.5 billion from 2018 until 2022."

To address this, it is recommended for the company to exert effort on Product Development in which it will automate the most standard operations that will help in reducing the operation expense of the company and will improve digital experience of consumers. Through Market Development and Market Penetration, the company will exert intensive marketing efforts in order to tap additional markets. Lastly, the company must continue its merger and acquisition in expanding its clientele. By 2021, through the successful implementation of the proposed strategies, the bank will be able to reduce its operating expense by 10%, increase its deposits and interest income by 20%, and loans by 16% with increments."
597,book_pic/image.jpg,Food Parks in the Philippines: A Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework ,"Paulino, Maria Luz Lourdes M. ",June,2018,PLM Business School,Doctor of Business Administration,Graduate School,"While the food park business in the Philippines has been steadily gaining ground since 2011, there have been reports of closures of independent food stalls due to difficulty of sustaining the business. This research was carried to determine the amenity values of food parks and evaluate the sustainability of food stalls in food parks, utilizing the RCOV Framework of Demil and Lecocq (2010), its Contribution to Economy, and the Entrepreneurial Management Competencies of the Food Stall Entrepreneurs. A Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework was developed to guide food stall entrepreneurs in the operation of their food stall business in food parks in the Philippines. METHOD: This study used descriptive-analytical method. Data were collected from 300 food stall entrepreneurs and 300 food park customers through multi-stage stratified random sampling utilizing the instrument developed by the researcher and conduct of focus group discussion (FDGD). The instruments were subjected to Cronbach Alpha Test and found valid and reliable. Collected data sets were analyzed using generally accepted (descriptive statistics) and specific statistical tools like t-test, ANOVA, and logistics regression. RESULT: All the food parks are in Metro Manila (NCR) and majority (61%) have been operating for about a year putting the industry in the “introductory” stage while adapting Porter’s 6th force to “complement” with the amenity values of the food park like the “No Dress Code” rule, hiring of security guards, ample parking space and wide selection of local and foreign food and beverages at reasonable prices. Food stalls are mostly owned by single proprietors (46%) initially investing between PhP100K to PhP200K (31%), has been operating between one year to less than two years (37%), and employing at least five people (88%). The estimated monthly expenses vary from PhP31K to PhP50K (48%) while enjoying a monthly income ranging from PhP51K to PhP70K (60%). Male entrepreneurs (55%) in their mid-30’s (27%), married with children (60%), college graduates, or professionals (83%) lead the ownership of food stalls. The funds invested in the food stall business came from other business interests (67%) and/ or personal savings (42%) with majority (60%) willing to risk about 50% of these investments in exchange for higher profits. Food park customers are female (68%), single (92%) millennials with ages between 18 to 24 years old (88%), college level students (87%), and enjoys monthly allowance of about PhP10K (66%) from parents to indulge in the food parks. Performance Level of Food Stalls. The food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers assessed as “High Level” the overall performance of food stalls in terms of Demil and Lecocq’s model. The food stall entrepreneurs assessed the three factors under Contribution to Economy as “Very High Level” whereas the food park customers assessed three factors as “High Level” only. In terms of Entrepreneurial Management Competencies, the food stall entrepreneurs assessed the factors of strategic awareness, leadership, communicating, and task orientations as “High Level” for the first factor and “Very High Level” for the other three factors, respectively. The food park customers, on the other hand, assessed all four factors as “High Level”. Significant Difference. There was a statistically significant difference in the assessment of the food stall entrepreneurs (x=3.14, SD=0.37814) and food park customers (x=3.06, SD=0.48502) conditions; t (598) = 2.506, p=0.040, on the performance of the food stalls in the food parks. The test of significant difference revealed that: (a) In terms of Demil and Lecocq’s RCOV model, all factors were found statistically significant except the “cook/chef” under “Competencies” factor (t-test=0.7121 and p-value=0.4767). Nonetheless, the “cook/chef” under the “Organization” factor was found statistically significant (t-test=2.874 and p-value=0.0042); (b) In terms of Contribution to Economy, “employment generation” (t-test=7.9438 and p-value=0.000) and “community involvement” (t-test=2.8744 and p-value=0.000) were found statistically significant; and, (c) In terms of Entrepreneurial Management Competencies, the factors of “leadership” (t-test=1.7065 and p-value=0.0884), “communicating” (t-test=5.964 and p-value=0.000), and “task orientation” (t-test=4.7757 and p-value=0.000) were found statistically significant. Significant Association. Using the Between Subjects Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), the results [F(3,597)=1.50837, p=0.21124] failed to reject the null hypothesis since p>0.05 level. Hence, there was statistically significant association on the assessment of the food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers on the performance of food stalls in food parks in the Philippines in terms of the variables mentioned in Problem Statement 2. Opportunities and Challenges. The three Opportunities ranked as top priority by the food stall entrepreneurs are: (1) Innovate, through the creation of new or the improvement of existing food and beverage products; (2) Increasing self-esteem with entrepreneurial mindset; and (3) Earn profit to support the needs of the family. On the other hand, the food park customers ranked as top three opportunities are: (1) Promote bonding with family and friend; (2) Satisfy customers and build customer loyalty; and (3) Innovate, through the creation of new or the improvement of existing products (food and beverage). The top three Challenges in operating food stalls in food parks in the Philippines ranked as priority by the food stall entrepreneurs are: (1) High financial risk at stake in the business; (2) Personal sacrifice and/or the loss of career of the owner; and, (3) Loss of productive and quality time with the family. Similarly, the food park customers’ ranking of the top three challenges faced by food stall entrepreneurs in the operation of food stalls in food parks in the Philippines are: (1) High financial risk at stake in the business; (2) Personal sacrifice and/or loss of career of the owner; and, (3) Willingness of the food stall entrepreneur to sacrifice social life, which is synonymous to the loss of productive and quality time with family and friends. Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework. The logistics regression result showed all factors under the Contribution to Economy were statistically significant: (a) Employment Generation (?=0.78808, z=3.90858; p=value=0.0009); (b) Revenue and Economic Activity Generation (?=1.01427, z=5.19758; p-value=0.0000); and, (c) Community Involvement (?=0.61266, z=3.34898; p-value=0.00081). In terms of the Entrepreneurial Management Competencies, all the factors, except for “Communicating”, were found statistically significant: (a) Strategic Awareness (?=1.06314, z=3.83466, p-value=0.00013); (b) Leadership (?=0.93960, z=3.35696, p-value=0.00079); and (c) Task Orientation (?=1.03311, z=3.48576, p-value=0.00049). Accordingly, in developing the Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework, the enhanced RCOV model, Balanced Growth Theory, results and findings of the study, and conclusions generated were considered.The statistically significant factors under the Contribution to Economy and Entrepreneurial Management Competencies using the logistics regression enter-method were entered in the formula initially yielding five factors to comprise the Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework with a correctly classified or trustworthy indicator value of 79.17%. These are: (1) Employment Generation; (2) Strategic Awareness; (3) Leadership; (4) Community Involvement; and, (5) Task Orientation. The final iteration using again the logistics regression enter-method for these five statistically significant factors yielded two factors to comprise the Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework with a correctly classified or trustworthy indicator value of 98.17%. These are: (1) Employment Generation (?=0.061388, z=5.52835, p-value=3.29796); and, (2) Leadership (?=0.077179, z=5.105612, p-value=3.29726). CONCLUSION: On the bases of the findings, the conclusions drawn are as follows: 1. The food park industry is still in the “introductory” or “take-off” stage because majority (61%) has been operating only for about a year (2017). The food parks in the Philippines adapt Porter’s 6th Force which complements the amenity values. 2. The food park industry is attractive to new entrepreneurs who would like to open a food business given that: (a) There are minimal barriers to new entrants because anybody with at least PhP100k can go into a food stall business; (b) Economies of scale is not applicable; (c) It is earning quite well as with other food businesses with estimated monthly net income ranging from PhP20k to PhP50k. 3. Male entrepreneur millennials having completed college and/or university education venture into the food stall business. Being tech savvy professionals, it can be surmised that these male entrepreneur millennials have studies well the risks and returns before going into the food stall business using their hard-earned money and personal savings, and considering it as a second career, especially the married ones. 4. Female, single, college-level students are the patrons of food parks, i.e., regular food park customers. They spend their allowances when indulging on their preferred food and beverages after school hours to relax and bond with friends since the operating hours of the food park starts from 4:00 o’clock to 12:00 o’clock midnight. 5. The sustainability factors in the RCOV framework of Demil and Lecocq, i.e., Resources, Competencies, Organization, and Value Proposition, provided a realistic preview and captured the normal operations of food stalls in food parks in the Philippines given the assessment of the food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers. 6. The food stalls in food parks in the Philippines are conduit to economic development, both at the local and national levels, in terms of employment generation, revenue and economic activity generation, and community involvement. 7. The food stall entrepreneur, in the day-to-day operations of the food stall business in food parks in the Philippines, is required to possess, at the very least, the following basic management skills: (a) Conceptual Skills to become strategically aware (Strategic Awareness) on the ins- and outs- of the food stall business and food industry; (b) Human Skills to lead people (Leadership) and harness their potential in the attainment of the overall objectives of the food stall through constant communication (Communicating); and, (c) Technical Skills to relate well with task-specific concerns (Task Orientation) in the operation of the food stall business like customer relations, waitering, cashiering, and even cooking. 8. The higher assessment of the food stall entrepreneurs as against the assessment of the food park customers on the level of performance of food stalls in terms of the variables mentioned in the Problem Statement 2 is expected and evidenced by the former being the owners of the food stalls and having a clear and perceptible operations of the food stall business than the latter. 9. The statistically significant association on the assessment of the food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers on the level of performance of food stalls in terms of the variables mentioned in Problem Statement 2 tells us that inherent in the operations of the food stalls by the former elicits and translates into the latter valuing through visiting i.e., eating and drinking in food stalls, the food parks in the Philippines. 10. While the assessment of the food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers on the opportunities encountered in the operation of the food stalls in food parks in the Philippines may be considered at the two ends of a continuum, the same can be construed to meet half-way. The focus of the food stall entrepreneurs’ is for the business to innovate its food and beverage products that is directed to the customers’ benefit. The food park customers’ assessment is for the food stall entrepreneur to focus its business and attention with the customers in mind, which is what the former is doing. Thus, it can be concluded that both food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers agree that the priority opportunity is the food park customer—the very reason for the existence of the food stalls in food parks in the Philippines. Likewise, about the challenges encountered by the food stall entrepreneurs in the operation of the food stalls in food parks, the food stall entrepreneurs and food park customers agreed that the priority is the high financial risk at stake, especially for the former because hard-earned money and personal savings were invested to finance the food stall business. 11. Based on the findings, the two factors combination best to comprise the Strategic Entrepreneurial Management Framework are Leadership and Employment Generation."

It evaluated the extent of influenced of 7 P’s of marketing mix, and it also attempted to explore the extent of influenced of the cultural factors to the buying behavior of the consumers. In addition, it analyzed the growth of the food park restaurant and the relationships of growth to the demographic profile, 7 P’s of marketing mix and cultural factors. It then tested the following null hypotheses: The significant difference in the assessments of administrators and food tourists as to the level of implementation of the following 7P’s of marketing strategy. In addition, the significant difference in the assessments of the two respondent-types as to the extent of influence of the cultural factors to the buying behavior of the consumers. And the significant relationship between the following independent variable namely; demographic profile, 7 P’s, cultural factors from dependent variable growth. This study was conducted in Quezon City using five different food parks. The descriptive-correlational method was used and the researcher made use of a survey questionnaire. The output from the questionnaire were summed up and these data were subjected for descriptive statistics such as frequency, percentage, weighted mean, Anova, and Z-test and were interpreted by describing the characteristics of the results obtained. The pertinent values for the variables subjected to multiple regression analysis were numerically evaluated on their influence to each other. The data were inspected and interpreted by the statistician using SPSS software. Based on the results of the study, the growth is calculated to be 1% for the period of three years which may be classified as slow growth, only annual income served as the predictor or contributory to growth of the food park. However, on the three (3) independent variables which include demographic profile, 7 P’s of marketing mix, and cultural factors, only 7 P’s of marketing mix contributes to the growth. All the analyses were compiled and analyzed accordingly and the Proposed Strategic Framework was formed to help sustain the operation of food park restaurant."

600,book_pic/image.jpg,Strategic Management Paper for Chesteel marine & Industrial Corporation ,"Nablo, Josie B. ",April,2019,PLM Business School,Doctor of Business Administration,Graduate School,"Chesteel Marine and Industrial Corporation (CMICORP) is one of the locally registered, family owned, categorized as small ship building and repair company (SBRC) in the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA). The most significant environmental factors to which the ship building and repair should effectively respond is the increasing number of shipping companies in the Philippines as well as the Philippine being ranked as the 4th largest ship building country according to MARINA’s 2017 annual report. One of the challenges of this industry is high competition due to the presence of foreign shipyards in the Philippines as well as huge number of domestic company offering same services. The industry has moderate entry barriers, low threat of substitution and the buyers and owners have bargaining power. The combination of five forces drives down the cost of services giving industry a small leeway of profitability. CMICORP currently have market share of 28.47% with average gross revenue of P46 million and an average income after tax of P1.5 million. In addition, CMICORP return on equity is at an average of 4.60% while the industry has an average of 17.74%. Congruent to the environment, industry, & company strengths & weaknesses and the successful implementation of the strategies, the financial objectives of the company are: • Increase CMICORP market share by 10% in 2022. This would mean that CMICORP needs to have a total increase of Php17,723,881.84 from 2017 gross sales in 2022 and a net income of Php2.080 million. • Increase the Return of Equity to 9.12% in 2022 (from 3.40% in 2017) thru parallel increase of net profit with sales. This would mean that operating cost, administrative cost and tax and interest should be kept at par with or lesser than the increase in gross revenue or market share. • Increase the Return on Assets to 5.33% in 2022 (from 2.33% in 2017) thru parallel increase of net profit with sales. Management should able to maximize the use of company assets thru careful consideration of capital investment, rate of return, depreciation, etc. The analysis of the external and internal factors shows that the strategies issues faced by CMICORP includes low market penetration, inadequate marketing plans and low business affiliation to promote their services and to develop new market. Improvement of the collection policy (financial strategy) and immediate resume of ISO certification (operational strategy) was also identified as areas for improvement. The strategic formulation process used the input tools to analyze external and internal factors and the matching tools to generate strategy options for CMICORP. The Strategic Position and Action Evaluation (SPACE) matrix indicated quadrant 2 or aggressive strategies. This aggressive position indicates that CMICORP should consider one or a combination of the following aggressive strategies: Market Penetration, Market Development, Product Development, Concentric Diversification, Horizontal Diversification, Conglomerate Diversification, Forward Integration, Backward Integration, and Horizontal Integration that will allow it to maximize its internal weaknesses and avoid external threats. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix classified CMICORP as Star. Similar to other major players in the industry, CMICORP tries to get as much as market share from this industry as it can but preference of clients still ruled. The Internal-External Matrix indicated Grow and Build strategies while The Grand Strategy (GS) matrix shows that CMICORP falls under the quadrant II with average rapid market growth and weak competitive position. Among the strategies generated by the SPACE matrix for CMICORP, the decision tool, Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM) heavily favors Market Penetration and Market Development. This paper recommends both Market Penetration and Market Development for CMICORP because it supports the corporate financial and strategic objectives. This will increase CMICORP market share and profitability as well as maximize its current resources."

This was prepared under the supervision of Dr. Roberto F. Villaroel. This 180-page study is based on the bankruptcy prediction model of Edward I. Altman, the Z”-Score used to determine the financial performance of the airlines with end in mind to identify the factors that influence the Z” score (interchangeably used to mean financial performance in this study), and to identify the basis for a strategic framework that will enhance the financial performance of the liberalized airline industry in the Philippines. Specifically, the study aims to provide information about the characteristics of the Airline Industry in the Philippines under the liberalized operation in terms of the Z” score, market structure, gross value added ratio of air to land – and- water transport, collusive tendencies in the airline industry, and price elasticity of demand of the airfare; the performance of the airline industry based on fiscal fitness in terms of liquidity, profitability, solvency and efficiency; if there significant changes in the fiscal fitness of the airline industry throughout the covered years in terms of the same financial aspects. If the Z”- Score possesses the predictive ability that holds true in the fiscal fitness of the Airline Industry in the Philippines; if there are correlations between the Z”- Scores of the Airline Industry and its fiscal fitness according to liquidity, profitability, solvency, and efficiency; the factors that affect the fiscal fitness of the airline industry according to financials, cost of services, market, economic, and operational. The strategies of the airline industry; the effects of these strategies employed by the airline industry in the enhancement of its financial performance; and finally, the framework –model that can be identified to be influential to the composite index of financial performance and sustainability. Descriptive analysis and inferential statistics have been employed in completing this study. Data were analyzed using the Altman’s Z’- score model, ratios in financial analysis, t-test, correlation coefficient, and multiple linear regression analysis. The study has found out that the airline industry is generally classified in the distressed zone based on the Altman’s Z”- Score with equivalent bond rating of non-investment grade. The airline industry belongs to a 4-firm oligopolistic market structure, it is slowly overtaking the land-and-water transport, there is collusive tendency to reduce airfare price, and relatively it is elastic as found through the arc price elasticity of demand. The airline industry’s liquidity, profitability, solvency and efficiency is not impressive, except with the selective years of a particular airline. All throughout the years studied, it has not shown significant improvement in these areas. The predictive ability of the Altman’s Z”- score holds true in the airline industry in the Philippines. There are several financial ratios that are having correlations, and therefore, have influence on the Z”- score. Certain factors in the market, economic and operational are also influencing the Z”- score of the industry. However, no actual bankruptcy recorded since ailing airlines are either consolidated with bigger ones, or enter into capital alliance. And evidently, surviving airlines are belonging to conglomerates, if not owned by a bigger airline. Several factors and strategies were also identified in the study that have influenced financial performance, such as, capital structure, cost structure, GNI, GNP, inflation rate, number of internet users, personal remittance, airfare, passenger demand, the market structure itself, the number of destinations, flights, code share, unbundling and surcharge, equipment optimization and preventive maintenance strategies, among others. And finally, this study, with the use of inferential statistics (multiple linear regression) was able to identify predictors that will enhance the financial performance of the airlines. These were used to recommend the basis for the strategic framework in enhancing the financial performance of the airline, using the metaphor of the different parts of the aircraft, i.e., the metaphor of “turbines” strengthening equity over debt financing, and mergers acquisition being the most potent predictors. On the other hand, using the metaphor of the “spoilers”, predictors that needed extra caution for the airlines are capital reorganizations and competitive airfare pricing. The metaphor of the “different important parts of the aircraft” are depicting the intervening predictors that determine an improved financial performance, explicitly expressed in the form of Z”- score are: codeshare agreements, hub-and-spoke, equipment optimization and preventive maintenance, and keeping sufficient assets over liabilities."

The instrumentation used for this study are survey questionnaire that were responded by the stakeholders of the City of Malolos and interview with PR experts. Data from the survey were tabulated and analyzed through specific statistical tool while the consultation from the interview were used in creating a Public Relation plan. The researcher concluded that based on findings of the study, there is a need to rebrand the city of Malolos. The stakeholders of the city of Malolos acceptability on the proposed rebranding for their city as the “City of the First Philippine Republic” is higher than the current branding of Malolos, “Vamos a Malolos”. It is shown in almost all aspects from the results of the survey and also from the interview conducted by the researcher with some Public Relations practitioner. Moreover, the proposed rebranding, Malolos as the “City of First Philippine Republic” is much simple to understand providing the city’s historical significance and identify while the current brand, “Vamos a Malolos” is quite problematic, because it creates another problem or questions than immediate answer. In addition, forecast that there is no immediate correlation between the prosed rebranding and economic advantage, according to him there are step by step process, if the administration of Malolos will perform and create realistic policies to promote the proposed rebranding of their City. The researcher recommend the consideration of the city administration of Malolos to formulate a City ordinance or policy towards the implementation of PR plan for the recognition and appreciation for the proposed rebranding of the City of Malolos as the “City of the First Philippine Republic”."

The study used a researcher-made survey questionnaire which was validated through expert validation. Data from this study were collected from Senior High School and College students of the said institution. Data gathered from the survey was validated through a Focus Group Interview participated by selected faculty moderators of the different student organizations. Findings of this study revealed the prevalence of Facebook as an effective tool in promoting student involvement. Results also revealed a high attendance of the students in the different programs. In connection to their attendance, it was discovered that students attend the different activities due to the fact that these activities are required activities. Findings also showed the passive participation of the students in the different activities. Students would prefer to be part of the audience rather than taking an active role in the programs. Finally, using the one way analysis of variation (ANOVA) it was concluded that there is a significant relationship between the communication strategies and extent of student involvement in different student program of activities. A proposed communication plan was developed to complement the results of the study."

The researcher utilized the descriptive method of an ex-post facto type of research design. The independent variables in the study were the size, type and location of the schools. These variables were used to determine whether or not they have statistically significant influences on the Mathematics performance of the students as measured on the NAT-Math This study found that: (1) There were significant changes in the performance of the Division in NAT-Math during the years 2003-2015 with the computed p-value of .001 which was lower than the critical p-value of .05; thus, the null hypothesis was rejected. Post Hoc Test revealed that school years 2003-2004 to 2004-2005; 2011-2012 to 2012-2013; and 2012-2013 to 2013-2014 indicated significant increases in the performance while 2013-2014 to 2014-2015 indicated a statistically decrease in the performance; (2) Small school obtained the highest mean in six (6) out of seven (7) school years and in overall mean as compared to medium and big schools; regular schools obtained the highest mean in four (4) out of the seven (7) school years and in the overall mean as compared to integrated and vocational schools; and District 2 obtained the highest mean in three (3)school years and in the overall mean as compared to other districts; (3) For the comparison of the means when the schools where grouped according to size, the computed p-values were: (a) 0.151, (b) 0.356, (c) 0.250, (d) 0.670, (e) 0.746, (f) 0.202, (g) 0.114, and (h) 0.138. Since, all the computed p-values were greater than the set significance level a= 0.05, this led to the decision of failing to reject the null hypotheses for each school year. (4) For the comparison of the means when the schools were grouped according to type, the computed p-values were (a) 0.984, (b) 0.444, (c) 0.737, (d) 0.191, (f) 0.054, (g) 0.266, and (h) 0.255. Since, all the computed p-values were greater than the set significance level a= 0.05, this led to the decision of failing to reject the null hypotheses for each school year. (5) For the comparison of the means when the schools were grouped according to location, the computed p-values were: (a) 0.181, (b) 0.635, (c) 0.882, (d) 0.792, (e) 0.619, (f) 0.784, (g) 0.451, and (h) 0.788. Since, all the computed p-values were greater than the set significance level a= 0.05, this led to the decision of failing to reject the null hypotheses for each school year. Found as well in the study was that there were no significant differences among the means of the schools when they were grouped according to size, type, and location. Therefore, no further investigations were conducted to identify the differences of school conditions and local school policies of each school categorizations to create intervention schemes. Meanwhile, it was found that the performance illustrates an erratic or unstable trend signifying the growth in the performance cannot be guaranteed. Hence, the researcher proposed intervention programs/activities that maybe conducted to improve the NAT-Math performance among the students. The stated findings led to the following conclusions: (1) The performance illustrates an erratic or unstable trend, where both upward and downward trend were observed in data; (2) Each school year distributions are positively skewed, implying that high-scoring schools were outnumbered by low-scoring schools on the NAT-Math. In addition, more than half of the schools in the Division of Manila were rated less than 50% MPS or in the Low Mastery Level. Only one school attained the Mastery Level of achievement (above 75); (3) The size and type of school do not statistically influence differences among the performance of schools in their NAT-Math scores when grouped according to location.Based on the conclusions, the following recommendations were proposed: (1) Continuously utilize the use of the NAT-Math in monitoring the achievement levels in order to improve school and classroom practice; (2) Continuous awarding of incentives to school employees for exceptional performance in the NAT such as the Performance Based Bonus (PBB); (3) Identified low-performing schools in the NAT-Math should be afforded assistance in improving their Mathematics performance; (4) The baseline of previous data encourage the Division of Manila to create sustainable changes that require focus, clarity, and continuous monitoring on short and long term goals for the improvement of Mathematics performance; and (5) A study along this line is recommended, especially one on identifying differences in school characteristics and conditions between high and low-performing schools on the NAT-Math."
606,book_pic/image.jpg,Comparative Analysis of Range and Endurance using Approximation Method and Flow Simulation ,"Engr. Joy Cosme G. Amores, Jr. ",October,2017,College of Education,Master of Science in Mathematics Education,Graduate School,"This research is aimed primarily in the comparison of two methods that can be used in the prediction of lift and drag of an aircraft. For basis of comparison, both methods predict the range and endurance of the Cessna 172S Skyhawk based on ten wing profile variation from different NACA airfoils. These two methods are Computational Fluid Dynamics via Flow Simulation Software and Quasi-Analytical Methods using Component Build-up Method. The Flow Simulation Software used in this study is embedded flow simulation in Solidworks 2015-2016 and the Component Build-up Method utilized the method of Raymer (1992) and Torenbeek (1982). Specifically, the researcher sought to answer the following questions: 1) What are the resulting polar drag equations of the modified Cessna 172S Skyhawk using the following Quasi-Analytical Method: A) Raymer’s Method and B) Torebeek’s Method? 2) What are the resulting lift and drag coefficients of the modified Cessna 172S Skyhawk using Flow Simulation? 3) What are the resulting and endurance of the modified Cessna 172S Skyhawk using Flow Simulation Method and the following Approximation Methods: A) Raymer’s Method and B) Torenbeek’ Method? 4) Is there a significant difference between the results of range and endurance using flow simulation method and each of the following approximation methods: A) Raymer’s Method and B) Torenbeek’s Method. This study is carried out to see the preciseness of the prediction of the component build up method from Raymer (1992) and Torenbeek (1982). It is the method most commonly taught in Aeronautical Schools in the country for prediction of lift and drag. In relation to the findings, the following conclusions were drawn: 1) the research revealed areas for improvement that could be done in the component build up method due to method error; 2) Raymer’s Method and Torenbeek’s Method for prediction of lift and drag through the initial polar drag equation proves to precise but only applies for the calculation of an aircraft’s endurance. Based on the formulated conclusions, the following recommendations are hereby advanced to Aeronautical Engineering Programs and Faculties: 1) Inclusion of the instruction of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) via flow simulation software in the subjects involving computer aided design; 2) integration of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) via flow simulation software in the subjects of Airplane Design and Applied Subsonic; 3) training of professors and technical instructors of Aeronautical Engineering in 3D modeling and CFD; 4) use CFD in the discussion of prediction of lift and drag. For future researcher, the following are also recommended: 1) verify constant multipliers used in the component build-up method for its improvement; 2) intensify results by adding more samples of airfoils and aircrafts and 3) propose a method of acquiring polar drag equation from the results of lift and drag coming from flow simulation."

Marissa Grace P.",May ,2017,College of Education,Doctor of Education major in Educational Management and Leadership,Graduate School,"This study was focused on the correlation of the sociodemographic profile and the self- concept and five personality dimensions of the respondents. Its findings will be the basis for an enhanced guidance program in the secondary schools of Pasay City. This study aimed to determine the following: the level of the respondents' self-concept and five personality dimensions based on the Tennessee Self- Concept Scale and International Personality Item Pool Measures; to determine if there is a relationship between the sociodemographic profile and self- concept of the respondents and their five personality dimensions; and to determine if there is a relationship between the respondents' self- concept and five personality dimensions. The quantitative-descriptive research was used with the questionnaires as its data-gathering instrument. The study tried to determine the relationship between the respondents' socio-demographic profile and their self- concept and personality dimensions. Tennessee Self- concept Scale and International Personality Item Pool are the instruments used to measure the self-concept and the five personality dimensions of the 599 respondents in the secondary schools in the Pasay City division. It was found out that the respondents' sociodemographic profile has no significant relationships with the self- concept internal frame of reference and external frame of reference except with the variables Gender and Family-Self. Among the five personality dimensions, only Neuroticism has significant relationship with the identity, physical and moral ethical-self variables of the self-concept scale. Conscientiousness personality dimension has significant relationship with Family-self variable. The other variables have no significant relationship with the personality dimensions. An enhanced Guidance Program will be presented to the division office of Pasay City for implementation in all secondary schools. Considering the respondents' weaknesses, male respondents are less affectionate and loving to their families. They don't tend to trust and comply easily at home and school. Their academic grades affect their being affectionate and energetic as well as their capabilities in dealing with life's challenges. The respondents' perceptions towards their identities, physical-selves and moral- ethical selves are affected by their personalities of being moody and emotional. Guidance of the respondents' families and schools are important and beneficial. The following recommendations may promote the self- concept and personality dimensions of the respondents: Various activities are recommended to help the students boost their self-concept as well as their personality traits. Increase in the students' achievement should also be given priority to help them increase their relationship with their families and peers. Seminar-trainings may be conducted to equip the guidance counselors/teachers the knowledge in the administration of personality tests to students. They are to administer personality tests to help students realize their strengths and weaknesses. Parents may be invited for conference so they could help the school in increasing the level of the students' self-concept/ Students who have low-self-concept may be recommended for regular counselling. Findings of this study may be shared with the school heads in the division so they can improve the guidance program with the assisstance of the guidance counselors and teachers in their respective schools."

Each school is requiring to organize and provide a remedial instruction in Science, English, AP, and Math in addition to regular classes in these critical subjects. The respondents of the study were the sixty (60) grade 7 students in Araling Panlipunan of Camarin High School in the Academic Year 2017-2018. The researcher employed the quasi-experimental design in this study as stated by Gasparrini and Bernal (2015). All respondents before the remedial class intervention scored poorly in the examination both in the traditional method and Quipper School intervention. Majority of the students scored higher and passed the post test after the remedial class. The Quipper School intervention group performed greater than that of the Traditonal method group. Among the competencies for both traditional and Quipper the competency about ""Nasusuri ang paghubog at pag-unlad ng kalikasan ng mga pamayanan at estado"" has rank the highest which means that after the remedial class, this is the competency where majority of the students improve. Findings show that there is no significant difference in the learning competencies of the respondents both in the traditional and quipper school intervention. The result of P-value for both the Traditional (0.116) and Quipper School (0.109) were both more than the significance level of 0.05, therefore, there is no significant difference in the learning competencies of the respondents based on the pre-test and post-test. Also, there is no significant difference in the learning competencies of the respondents based on the posttest utilization both in the traditional and Quipper School. Thus, using any of the method works well in students who are part of any remedial program. Thus, the researcher recommended that school administrators should take part in conducting remedial classes and crafting remedial program in each subject area involved with educational technology in order to revolutionize the teaching and learning culture.

Based on its findings, the researcher crafted an enhancement training-workshop for the purpose of attaining a high degree of teaching performance among subject faculty members in the study. Ninety-nine (99) subject faculty members and nine (9) academic heads for a total of one hundred eight (108) in all as subject respondents. In the gathering of data, two sets of questionnaires were used. For the academic heads, a researcher-adapted questionnaire was utilized. For the subject faculty members, the PLM evaluation questionnaire was employed. By using the weighted mean in finding out the kind of leadership behavior of the academic heads of PLM, the findings revealed that all academic heads are very evident in their perceptions and therefore considered as transformational leaders. On the other hand, the teaching performance of the faculty members was observed to be highly satisfactory based on the overall mean rating of the four (4) major areas of faculty performance such as: mastery of the subject matter, professional development, classroom management, and human relations. Pertaining to the relationship between the transformational leadership behavior of the academic heads and the teaching performance of the subject faculty members, the findings revealed that there was no significant relationship between the two major variables, thus accepting the null hypothesis that there was no significant relationship between the transformational leadership behavior and teaching performance. Based on the findings and conclusions of the study, the following recommendations were introduced: Firstly, that the transformational style of leadership should be fostered among the key administrators of PLM to develop and promote the best practices in both academic and administrative areas; Secondly, improving the teaching performance of the subject faculty members should be given topmost priority; Thirdly, an urgent need for an inspiration towards the attainment of excellent performance; Fourth, more incentives to performing employees in the form of scholarships abroad, promotion, and pay increases; and lastly, the herein proposed Enhancement Training-Workshop should be conducted to obtain excellent performance of the faculty members of the University.

Evidently, I-IIV has been one of fastest rising epidemic in world, and the Philippines is regarded as one of the top countries in Asia that recorded to have the highest HIV infection growth with 29 new HIV cases daily as of 2017 and of 82% of reported new cases were among males who have sex with males. This inspired the researcher to make a study about people living with HIV and find out if attachment styles affect their risky sexual behavior together with its coping strategies. The research study utilized a descriptive correlational method that helped identified the attachment styles, sexual risk behavior, and coping strategies of 100 respondents living with HIV, that acquired the disease through MSM with the age group of 18 to 35 year old. The researcher used three (3) standardized test namely: Experience Closed Relationship-Revised, Brief Sexual Attitude Scale, and Ways of Coping, and one (1) socio-demographic questionnaire to gather the respondent's socio-economic status, age, educational attainment, and nature of work. Findings of this study revealed that the respondents manifested high in attachment-related anxiety and high in attachment related avoidance. PLHI had a moderately high score in communion and condom use and utilized positive reappraisal as their top coping strategy. Socio-demographic profile showed no significant relationship with attachment-related anxiety and attachment-related avoidance. However, age showed significant relationship with permissiveness and instrumentality In addition, result also presented that condom use has a significant relationship with socio-economic status and educational attainment. Attachment-related anxiety showed no significant relationship with. sexual risk behavior. On the other hand, attachment-related avoidance presented to have a significant relationship with instrumentality. The study revealed that attachment-related anxiety has no significant relationship with coping strategies. Attachment-related avoidance showed significant relationship with seeking social support. Sexual risk behavior such as communion, instrumentality and condom use has no significant relationship with coping strategies. While, permissiveness showed significant relationship with confrontive coping. The conclusion derived from the study presented that: PLHIV with high in both anxiety and avoidance attachment were not the result of being a low income earner, nor influenced by age, education and nature of work. PLHIV who are young adults tend to be less permissive in engaging in risky sexual activities. PLHIV that came from the low income earners still practiced safe sex in order to protect reputation, evecially majority of them are educated. Due to maturity, PLHIV appeared to be less accommodating towards risky sexual behavior and still hopeful in seeking serious type Of relationship. PLHIV who are attachment avoidant still seek support by being selective as to whom to trust with and preferred to be involved in a much smaller group. PLHIV have manifested the tendency to aggressive as their coping strategy in order to maintain exclusive relationship with their primary partners. The recommendations were as follows: The implementation, of the proposed Holistic Wellness Program would be helpful to the PLHIVs' self enhancement and family relationship. PLHIV should improve their self-worth and self-respect by being mindful, removing negative thoughts and replacing it positive one. PLHIV should also improve harmonious relationship with their family. Open communication within the family of PLHIV should be encouraged. "

The result of the experiment was used as basis for developing an energy sustainability action plan among grade 9 learners of Batasan Hills National High School. Specifically it sought to answer the following questions : (1) What is the demographic profile of the grade 9 learners in terms of the following factors. A. monthly family income; B. number of siblings in the family; C. distance of residence to school; D. number of meals per day; E. utility bills and mode of transportation? (2) What is the carbon footprint of the learners before and after the intervention when grouped according to demographic profile in (a) control group (b) experimental group? (3.) Is there a significant difference on carbon footprint of the grade 9 learners before and after the intervention in (a.) control group and (b.) experimental group? (4.) What action plan can be developed based on the result of the study? The study utilized a quasi-experimental design to assess if there was a significant difference before and after the intervention in control and experimental group. It was participated by 200 learner-respondent identified using non-probability purposive sampling technique. The learner-respondent were divided into two groups in random selection. From each section 100 learner-respondents were assigned as the control group and 100 as the experimental group. Strategic Intervention Material (SIM) utilized in the study undergone validity test. Statistics such as frequency, percentage and ranking were employed to come up with the result of the demographic profile. Average mean was utilized to measure the carbon footprint of the learner-respondents on the pre-assessment and post-assessment. In the test significant difference, paired t-test was utilized. The result showed that majority of the respondents confined on level 2 and 3 aggregate family income a low family income group that is the reason why learner-respondents are enrolled in public school; most of the learner-respondents has a relatively low family members, most of them are relatively near the school community so they tend to emit low carbon footprint; most them eat four times a day; manage to decrease their utility bills such as electric bill and water bill; and usually walk and ride a tricycle when going to school. For the average mean of the carbon footprint of learner-respondents when it comes to monthly family income, as family income increases their mean carbon footprint also increases; for number of siblings in the family, the higher the number of siblings the higher carbon footprint emission they emit; the higher the distance to travel the higher carbon emission they emit; an increase meals may lead to an increase in carbon emission; and most of the learner-respondents tend to walk or ride a tricycle when going to school since most of them are relatively near the school community. The average mean of the carbon footprint of the learner-respondents decreases before and after the discussion and intervention in control group and experimental group. There was no significant difference on the carbon footprint of the learner-respondents after the discussion in control group because there was no intervention applied to this group while in experimental group there was a significant difference before and after the discussion and intervention because of the use of the SIM as an intervention. The Strategic Intervention Material (SIM) greatly affects the awareness and practice of the learner-respondents as shown on their carbon footprint emission in post-assessment. The results suggest that the of SIM in Earth Science was more effective in improving the students carbon footprint to become environmentally aware and improve environmental practices in conserving and sustaining the energy in the environment. The higher mean gain score in experimental group before and after the intervention is the key indicator that significant difference existed among the two groups presented in the study. Thereby stating that the Strategic Intervention Material (SIM) entitled “One Planet Lifestyle” is effective in the enhancement of the Energy Sustainability Action Plan presented by the researcher in concentration with the topic about climate change and carbon footprint."

In the industry, threat of new entrants is high because if its attractiveness of the market. Given the monopolistic nature of the industry, the critical success factors that have found to be important in order to succeed in the industry are technical skills, price competitiveness, good customer service, partnership and efficient financial management. ECEC is behind its key competitors in terms of technical skills and financial management but they are outstanding in terms of products, services, and partnership. The company has obtained outstanding score of 3.01. ECEC is higher than Gram Industrial and EESi. Technical skills, price competitiveness, products and services offered, and partnership are considered the strengths. However, the advantage of EESi is its price competitiveness, good customer service, and efficient financial management in CPM. There are opportunities and threats in the industrial automation and control system industry that must be considered in order for it to successfully create strategies and respond to environmental forces. The company’s response is the average to existing opportunities and threats in the automation and control system industry. Philippines’ concerted efforts toward infrastructure development, economic advancement, and rise of automation in the workplace will give the company opportunities for growth and expansion. The industry shows a lot of potential as the economy continue to grow. However, increase in inflation rate and TRAIN Law will be a barrier as manufacturers need to slow down in automation and process optimization due to high cost. Exponent Controls and Electrical Corporation has a rating of 2.58 in the EFE Matrix. In evaluating the internal strengths and weaknesses of ECEC, it needs to address its turnover rate of accounts receivables, high turn operational expense, employee turnover rate, unsatisfactory employee compensation benefits, and reward program in order to improve its operation. However, the company’s technical expertise and reliable service remains to be a factor that distinguishes ECEC against its competitors. Its internal factor evaluation of 2.42 signifies that the company’s internal position is weak. In evaluating both internal and external factors, ECEC may consider using market penetration strategies to be able to achieve its vision to be the most preferred partner in Instrumentation, Systems and Automation solutions in the Philippines. These strategies may be implemented by strengthening its relations to existing clients and improving their sales support and create competitive package with competitive pricing based on the industry. Also, they may consider intensifying telemarketing and marketing channels across the country especially in places with numerous manufacturing sites.

Palad,,2018,PLM Business School,Master in Business Administration,Graduate School,"The banking industry has been rapidly developing the use of internet or online banking as an efficient and viable tool to improve customer satisfaction. It is one of the most revolutionary initiatives done by traditional banks in order to provide quicker and more reliable services to their stakeholders. Due to the fact-paced development of computer technology and as a commercial tool in internet or online banking, there is a huge potential for it to be used to attract more customers and expand consumer base. Looking into the correlation between online banking services and customer satisfaction is important to helping banks to sustain its competitive advantage. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine and assess how different factors of online banking systems of the top five universal banks in the Philippines, namely, BDO, Unibank, Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (Metrobank), Bank of the Philippines Islands, China Banking Corp., and Philippine National Bank, enhance customer satisfaction. These factors include customers’ socio-demographic characteristics, extent of use of online banking systems, perception of the components of online banking systems, and perception on the service quality of online banking. Using quantitative descriptive research design, the research gathered data using a survey questionnaire to 260 respondents working in the National Capital Region (NCR) of the Philippines using purposive sampling. This number was determined using Cochran’s Formula no=Z2 p q) e2, where no= sample size, Z= Z value (1.96) at a margin of error, e=0.05, p=estimated proportion of the population, and q=1-p. Respondents provided valuable feedback pertaining to the above factors by sharing their experiences with regards to online banking systems of their respective banks. For the purposes of this study, customer satisfaction was measured by the number of years the respondents have stayed with their banks. The longer time spent with the bank, the more satisfied they are with the services they are getting. In view of this study on online banking system and its possible efficient enhancement to customer satisfaction, this study made a hypothesis that there is no significant relationship between the extent of satisfaction of the customers toward online banking. A panel of experts in Banking and Business Management validated the items for each item’s relevance and importance to the study. The Cronbach’s Alpha was used to verify whether all the evaluative items are reliable. Fifteen (15) samples were considered, yielding a reliability coefficient, a= 0.962, interpreted as highly reliable, with 53 items. After properly answering the questionnaire, the data collected were analyzed and interpreted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v.21). The level of significance used in the statistical analysis of hypotheses was 5% and presented frequency distribution tables and bar graphs. Statistical methods of dispersion were also used in the study. The Chi-Square test was used to associate the respondents’ customer satisfaction related to their demographic characteristics (non-parametric measure for association of nominal variables). The parametric tool, Multiple Correlation / Regression Analysis was also used to determine the extent of relationship between the independent variables (factors of online banking systems) and the dependent variable, customer satisfaction. This statistical tool was used to establish the extent of association between the dependent variable as brought about by the possible effects of the independent variables, whether direct or inverse, as represented by the beta coefficients of the multiple regression equation, ANOVA, Stepwise. Based on the results, it can be disputed that the variables listed have a significant relationship to customer’s overall satisfaction, namely, (1) socio-demographic characteristics, except for gender; (2) the use of online services and hand-held devices; (3) the following features of online banking: Pay Bills, Manage Account, Alert Features, Fund Transfer, and Wire/Telegraphic Transfer; (4) the aspects of Reliability, Cost of Transactions, Convenience, and Opening/Closing Time; (5) the characteristics Security, Ease of Use, and Reliability; and (6) a positive perception on the service quality of online banking systems. The researcher recommends that stakeholders use the data gathered in this research to utilize online banking systems to their full potential, as well as provide ample regulations to make online banking systems secure, safe, and user-friendly to the stakeholders involved."

Recently, the Philippines have been experiencing a drop at unemployment rate currently at 5.7% from 6.1%. Although this is the case, there are still 2.443 million jobless Filipinos and the fact that unemployment is still a major problem cannot be denied. People that are oblivious to different job opportunities is considered as one of the reasons for the unemployment issue. This is due to the unfair distribution or lack of information on job opportunities, so people are unable to know the new job vacancies. It means that there are some jobs available, but jobseekers do not have access to that information. The most common case of jobseekers that do not have access to job vacancies information are the blue-collar workers. Applayan is a job posting mobile application that properly matches together a job listing and a job applicant and links them to employers. The purpose of the project is to enable companies to conduct a job caravan efficiently by having adequate data regarding the applicants residing in the same areas.

Depression is a real illness and carries with it a high cost in terms of relationship problems, family suffering and lost work productivity. Yet, depression is a highly treatable illness. While everyone occasionally feels sad or ""blue,"" these feelings tend to pass rather quickly. By contrast, someone with depression experiences extreme sadness or despair that lasts for at least two weeks or longer. Depressed individuals tend to feel helpless and hopeless and to blame themselves for having these feelings. Depression interferes with activities of daily living—such as working or concentrating on tasks, or even eating and sleeping. Other possible symptoms of depression include chronic pain, headaches or stomach aches. Some people may feel angry or restless for long periods. People who are depressed may become overwhelmed and exhausted and stop participating in certain everyday activities altogether. They may withdraw from family and friends. Some depressed individuals may have thoughts of death or suicide. Many research studies have demonstrated that psychotherapy, or talk therapy, is effective for treating depression and relieving symptoms experienced by individuals who suffer from depression. Psychological treatments may prevent a person with milder depression from becoming more severely depressed. And although a past history of depression increases the risk of future episodes, there is evidence that ongoing psychotherapy may lessen the chance of recurrence. "

Quillo, Angelo Rufino A.",February,2018,College of Engineering and Technology,Bachelor of Science in Information Technology,Undergraduate,"Alcohol has a very significant effect on the functions of the body which are vital to driving and being able to function. Alcohol is a depressant, which mainly affects the function of the brain. Alcohol first affects the most vital components of the brain and ""when the brain cortex is released from its functions of integrating and control, processes related to judgment and behavior occur in a disorganized fashion and the proper operation of behavioral tasks becomes disrupted."" People driving under the influence of alcohol are commonly referred to as drunk drivers, or drink-drivers. When charged with this as a crime, it may either be referred to as a DUI (Driving Under the Influence) or a DWI (Driving While Intoxicated), where a DUI is generally considered to be a lesser crime. Studies have been performed to identify commonalities between severe drunk driver. To prevent this crime the researchers conducted a study and designed a system that is a microcontroller based anti-drunk driving with vehicular safety system which aims to help reduce the number of vehicular accidents which involves drunk-driving. Along with the safety of the driver, this study also guarantees public safety. The system measures the breath alcohol concentration of the driver to determine if he is capable of driving. If not, the system will block the electric current and will not permit the driver to start the engine. Moreover, the system also alert authorities and relatives when accident takes place through GSM module."

The color psychology affects the human lives in many ways. People wearing certain colored clothes claim sharper awareness, more confidence as well as greater energy. Color can indeed influence a person; however, it is important to remember that these effects differ between people. Factors such as gender, age, and culture can influence how an individual perceives color. For example, males reported that red colored outfits made women seem more attractive, while women answered that the color of a male's outfit did not affect his attractiveness."
